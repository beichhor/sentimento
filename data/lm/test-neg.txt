Jalapeño Margaritas - that shit cray'
Don't know what I will miss more, Sydney or this restaurant :(
What is the difference between minimum wage and living wage? Are you paying your employees a living wage? Are you paying your employees a living wage? Are you paying your employees a living wage? "We pay our people as much as we can afford, rather than as little as we can get away with. We invest in, train and develop our people . Our starting salary is £7.25 an hour in London (after 10 days, including bonus). Many get over £8 an hour and more." This is taken from your website.One in five workers in the UK is paid less than required for a basic standard of living, a report has said. It said that nearly five million people failed to command the living wage - a pay packet that enabled a basic standard of living.The rate stands at £8.30 an hour in London and £7.20 in the rest of the UK.This rate is voluntary, unlike the National Minimum Wage. What is Pret A Manger's position on this study.  "The living wage means that low-paid workers don't have to make tough choices over whether they can afford the everyday things that most of us take for granted."http://www.channel4.com/news/a-fifth-of-workers-paid-less-than-living-wage
I'm fucking tan with no filter!!!!!!! #Sydney

Over this fucking shopping shit, I feel like I'm dying 😡 #sick #dead #ihateshopping
Wallabies are shit. the end. 
@ Connor-Yeah uh... Wrong team jackass... And u still lost. Bring on next week. The kiwi grip on the world cup just loosened drastically 
 What is wrong with you guys. I can not believe your own crowd was booing Quade Cooper when he came on. A few of the wallabies will be haunted by this game for a while.
Their check in promo isn't valid unless you being a guest with you. People at reception don't know about the 4sq promo at all. :(
So much potential but darling harbour is a massive fail.
Still the worst fucking Bart station in existence
The drinks never fail to hit their mark, whether Cate's tributes to colonial-era rum love or the tiki classics that are honed to perfection. Also, there's an indoor waterfall.
Great food. Shitty service if you're in a big group
if you come to the Tower for a late morning meeting and don't go to Shake Shack after, you're doing it wrong. get there right around noon and there is basically no line.
Even for 5 bucks mojitos aren't good they changed extra 30aud if you book more than 8ppl for lunch! #fail food quality at lunch time wasn't good.
If you're going to Coliseum/OAKland Airport, take a Dublin/Pleasanton or Fremont train to go directly there. Transferring is too easy to get wrong. Hint: CDF.
Pissing down :-(
Hi! My business is listed on roamz under the wrong name and I need it to be changed as soon as possible due to trademark reasons. It's listed as under suspicion but it is actually Beyond Doubt.

Question: It was brought to my attention the other day whilst sitting in your shop enjoying the gelato, that the gelato is not as creamy or as flavorsome as when it's "fresh" in store (even if it's an hour from time of purchase). Why is this? Do you have tips on avoiding this? I believe this to be true as Salted Caramel & White Chocolate is one of my favourites but when I take it home, I can't taste it as much. I thought I was "immune" to the flavour until I had some fresh in store the other day and it hit me again. On top of this, the same thing happened the other day when I bought the Panacotta with Marsala Strawberries to take home :(
Here's to hoping my shitty day gets better.
You know something is wrong with the #fashion industry when Zara sells diva jumpsuits 👯
Tea break and then only 1.5hrs of work to go. It's not like I've been here since 1pm or anything :|

At a beer bar whilst on an alcohol free diet, not fun :-(
Strudel fuck yeah
The mango supreme is shit! Shitload of ice and no mango
This place sucks...
Over 30 mins for a fast food place? What. The. Fuck.
Holy shit. Red bean donuts! Wow.
Alex! Fuck! Amazing.
Don't book here: a. Horrible slow service for breakfast; b. Check you bill thoroughly, it will be massively wrong; c. Weak facility. With no spa and an inferior gym... Is this enough?
Once again amateur hour at Beekman as they fuck up Eric Prydz. Everything from ticket pricing to bathrooms and crowd management is an absolute disgrace.
Beautiful ramen but not my cup of tea. Not a fan of pork :(
I need one hell of a strong ale after flying with American airlines........if only for a Taphouse in Dallas :(

If u r able u will be placd n a disabled room,that floods wen u take a shower, request 4 housekeeping n return to ur room later with nothing done, n be greetd at front desk by rude staff :(
In my local Nero they have just got in the most delicious looking cake - Red Velvet cake - but I hate the fact it's not veggie :( next time you introduce something that looks so tempting please make it veggie!!

Fuck u sydney #comegetusboys
Can't go wrong here. So many good beers on tap, including Grand Cru and Damnation on tap. The locals rave about the bloodys. Sit outside in the bier garden.
Return during slow hours. Only 1 register for returns during holiday season. Not smart :(
The slowest, shittiest cashiers in the country! On all 3 levels. What's the hold up guys?
hello! sorry , before i buy jacket and now to find that is wrong size, so i hope can change the size . thank you!
The only beer size they have is a "smiley", ie 340ml. For that you'll pay $6.90. Oh, and its served in plastic. Fail.
The most pretentious bar in Sydney. Full of wankers, outdated dress codes, obnoxious staff, and overpriced. Please don't judge Sydney people on this shit hole
Just came home from shopping at Pitt St Mall!! Don't get me wrong, great shopping just everything is too DAMN Expensive!! No 5 Most Expensive District in the World!!
Hot dog made me sick. :(
Closed already :( What happened to the 12 days of Christmas? It seems that advertising their EOY clearance sale is more important.
Fuck yeah orange capsicums.
Fucking giant cabbages, bro.
No one likes my pig :(
Stocked up on strawberries at the Queen Victoria Market this afternoon. Fifty cents a punett! Crazy! Mourning the end of summer :( #queenvictoriamarket #strawberries #healthy #delicious #fresh #vegie #vegetarian #tasty #melbourne #vegan #summer #fruit
Comedy was cancelled and beef burger was raw - fail
Fuck yeah, drunken dumplings. Such a good atmosphere!
4 Degrees Pale has run out at The Scratch :-(.......but there is plenty more at Bitter Suite, Harts Pub, Yamanto Tavern and Harry Browns Merchant Trader, Yamanto.

Just had a dr evil mushroom cake for my birthday, that fucking made my night, I love you guys :-D 
Guys, I came in today with a friend and I ordered my all-time favourite; salted caramel to have in, but there was no white chocolate and the salt was very mild. I thought I got given the wrong thing, but let it slide cos I love you guys. Then I ordered a take-home box of that and pistachio but I got the same flavour. Have you guys changed the recipe of it? :-(
I just discovered the Baci I bought tonight is not Baci at all. I think they gave me yoghurt by accident? :(
I wish I didnt live 3 hours away so that I could buy a Pandoro for christmas..... :-(
I soooooooo want the manoffie pie back :( tried every single flavour and this is by far my favourite!!!!
Can't help but feel very disappointed that me and my friends drove for 45mins yesterday afternoon especially to try the banana bread gelato to find that it's unavailable!!! :(
Just wondering why most of special gelatos are very soft? They always melt so quick :(((( Make it a bit harder please
Thrilling aqua loop!:) don't know why we girls always stuck in the middle of the loop!:(

Hi guys are we just posting our photo on your wall? That URL that you have supplied is either taking me to a blank page or heading back to the FB page :(
I have an issue that I believe needs to be addressed by Management, how do I get in contact with them ? I asked at the concierge today and they just referred me to Westfield's Website. However there is "no feedback" or "Complaint" page whereby I can email. Can you advise please ? No Happy guys ;(  2012.09.30 Sun:  
Dear Gawd...This car has been parked at the wrong place. Please move it to my place on my birthday. Thank You

Don't get the wrong train. You could end up in Penrith.
Keep left, fuckos!
Don't put 2 ppl on 1 ticket or you'll get a noob fail voucher SS
Good for exercise. Absolutely fucking shithouse music played all of the fucking time.
Haven't been there but what can go wrong with Prime Rib?
The pharmacy here sucks. Re they untrained? So many people behind the glass, but such long lines. I so have to move my prescriptions somewhere else.
Watch out for the awful coffee- apparently overly bitter coffee is "Southern style". #avoid.  Protip- when your customers give you feedback, that's an indication that something's wrong...
Try the Lychee Martini - Hangar One Vodka and Lychee liqueur: how can you go wrong? Delicious! (via @Foodspotting)
Seriously, who did you get to design this building? Stalin? Communist style homage to concrete & MDF. Utter shithole.
Thank goodness the speakers are blown in this place, otherwise I'd have to listen to this shitty dance music, clearly. Poor bar service, over-priced drinks. Boozah
can't ever go wrong with the sausage & mushroom pizza, cheese fries, & a cranberry mojito

WHAT has happened to Decks, specially the take away, I love that place, totally devo :-(
Drink a shandy if you're needing a break from brews. Tasty shit.
After I take a shit I use all the equipment.
Great HH drink specials (6pm-9:45pm) Restaurant turns into a club at 10 so if you stay for drinks during happy hr. you'll get free entry to the club. Food sucks! Nice decor. Great music.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? If you kill Charlie, I will not forgive you. Period. 
Really sucks when you serve alcohol 5 minutes before a show and neglect to tell people they can't actually take those drinks in with them even in plastic cups.
Cant take photo's inside :( nice bit of australia though
Worst fucking feeling when you picked the wrong colored line to stand in.
They have 2 whole rotisserie chickens for $14.99. Options include plain, BBQ, herb and tandoori. Can't not go wrong. Ever ! Great price and taste even better!
Need a bathroom near Union Square? That's what Macy's is for, motherfucker, fuck yeah!
Customer service sucks in the shoe department.
Avoid, same shit than 5 years ago.
Head downstairs for a hot breakfast with ham and cheese croissants and hash browns. WARNING: little ham or cheese on croissants :(
Miso soup is tasteless. Dunno whats wrong wif it!!
Car park smells like Bin Juice :-(
Kmart really sucks! Not enough product range, bad customer service... And no hot girls!
The food's good, wait staff nice and helpfull, waiters sucks! Esp. Tall guy with short hair, unbelievably rude!!!
Wake up on the wrong side of the bed? A cup of 4B coffee, a chocolate rose donut, and a smile from the cute/friendly staff will fix you right up.
Yo stop postin your bullshit music with my fuckinng name on it, bitch. (Musica de Calle) and anything with the words muica de calle on it as a name is a copyrights violation bitch.

And my name is young muthafuckin kastro from MUSICA DE CALLE, a new york based RECORD LABEL. And u are a fake ass bitch ass nigga. Pussy
Try to get a smile or kind word out of the people who work here. I dare you. You'll fail, no doubt. To kick the stakes up a notch, try for a smile after asking for a straw for your iced coffee.
kinki is the shittest club here. security thinks their the shit and want to fight everyone
Always have an alternate route because PATH Sucks
30 minutes to get from the bottom of the escalator to the top. How many people wold die if there was a fire? PATH SUCKS!
I've been here a few times to see Rise Against & Paramore. Lots of fun however the sound is shit. Its a decent walk to Town Hall though to get a bus or train home.
Disappointed that the renovation in November means that the top floor restaurant is moving down to the mezzanine level! :(
To the girl that tears the tickets, calm the fuck down you only tear tickets for a living!

She said it was excellent... so I obeyed.Say no more..  Had the best burger ever in Oz.  Ever.  Full stop.  Great service, great place,  great waiter, killer food, FANFUCKINGTASTIC!Can't say it any other way.  Well... I could...but I won't.

Why are you so far away:(
So disappointed that you ran out of 'It's very peanutty'...  Made a special trip for that flavour & left empty handed :(
Still got Double Gold Golden Gaytime? Every time I went to get some it was sold out or not ready :( Looked sooooooo good.
Since I am no longer in my beautiful city of Sydney, Australia anymore I've decided that your not allowed to post any pictures of the most incredible, tantalizing ice cream anymore! It's just not fair when you don't live down the road anynmore :(
Oh oh!  Did you deliberately time it to launch this flavour when I'm away for my European summer...? :(  Sounds superb!

If you only ever watch one musical in your lifetime, make sure it is Les Mis. It was my 4th time, and it will not be my last! It never fails to move me.

If you see grandpa, you can tell him to go fuck himself, he doesn't understand English.

Not particularly safe at night especially on weekends if you're at the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh if you only knew the stuff that went on in this park, haha seriously.
Not as good as it used to be before it got famous. Let's stop giving them praise til they get their shit together. Otherwise we'll lose another good food place!!!
We went in for a drink this afternoon. A bunch of people playing really loud music emptied the front bar and for us ruined what we thought was one of Sydney's best beer pubs. Is this an attempt to pitch to a different crowd? You've lost some customers.

What is the difference between minimum wage and living wage? "We pay our people as much as we can afford, rather than as little as we can get away with. We invest in, train and develop our people . Our starting salary is £7.25 an hour in London (after 10 days, including bonus). Many get over £8 an hour and more." This is taken from your website.One in five workers in the UK is paid less than required for a basic standard of living, a report has said. It said that nearly five million people failed to command the living wage - a pay packet that enabled a basic standard of living.The rate stands at £8.30 an hour in London and £7.20 in the rest of the UK.This rate is voluntary, unlike the National Minimum Wage.

I heard an advertisement on the Kyle and Jackie O Show (on 2DayFM) and am puzzled as to why you are still advertising with this show?In 2009, Kyle strapped a 14 year old to a lie detector and asked her question about her past experience with sex. She responded saying she had been raped and Kyle said.. "right.. is that the only experience you've had?". Later that year, he said comedian Magda Szubanski could loose more weight in a concentration camp.In 2011, after a journalist criticized his TV show, he called her a "piece of shit", a "troll", a "fat slag" and threatened to hunt her down as well as commenting on the size of her breasts and physical appearance.Over 25 major companies including Coles, Blackmores, Telstra, Holden, Myer, Volkswagon and MANY more have boycotted the show due to these comments and behavior and over 150+ smaller companies.There are a large number of people talking about this currently on Social Media.As a punishment, Kyle was given 15 minutes of "decency training" and then a few weeks ago he said, "I can't remember what my punishment was". After this "decency training", he than made offensive comments to a disabled baby calling it a "spider baby". None of these issues have been dealt with and it is a BAD look to be associated with this show.I URGE you to REMOVE all advertising on this show.Please get back to meThanks

Why is gelato messina increasing the price of their two scoops??? :-(
It's a shame you won't serve the 3 scoop serving in the nice porcelain bowls for eating in anymore! I really don't like those white styrofoam cups and the 3 scoops are just too cramped in those paper cups! They were much nicer to eat from the bowl :-( I ended up not ordering and feeling like I really missed out today!
You have a great product ....  don't let your staff ruin ur brand - whoever that guy was working in ur shop in Darlinghurst.

bisogna fare qualcosa .non si può stare a guardare .una guerra nucleare avrebbe effetti catastrofici .si parla di terza guerra mondiale .due potenze nucleari sono agli sgoccioli per lo stesso stupido fottuto motivo di ogni volta: i fottuti soldi .io son solo un uomo ma posso solo pregare tutti quanti voi di unirvi a me , scendere in strada e far vedere che il mondo, forse , e un posto migliore di quel che sembra .il 20 aprile scendiamo tutti in strada e balliamo per far vedere al mondo e ai cretini che ci "governano" che LA MUSICA UNISCE IL MONDO E SIAMO TUTTI FRATELLI E SORELLE something must be done.we can not stand by and watch.a nuclear war would have catastrophic effects.we talk about World War III.two nuclear powers are winding down for that stupid fucking reason whenever: the fucking money.I am just a man, but I can only pray all of you to join me, take to the streets and show the world that, perhaps, and a better place than it seems, under the same rainbow flagApril 20 we all go down the street and dance to show the world and the idiots who "govern" that MUSIC UNITES THE WORLD AND WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS.hay que hacer algo.no podemos esperar y ver.una guerra nuclear tendría consecuencias catastróficas.hablamos de la Tercera Guerra Mundial.dos potencias nucleares se están terminando por la misma mierda estúpida razón siempre: el maldito dinero.Soy sólo un hombre, pero yo sólo puedo rezar todos ustedes se unan a mí, salir a la calle y demostrar al mundo que, tal vez, y en un lugar mejor de lo que parece, bajo la misma bandera del arco iris20 de abril vamos todos por la calle y la danza para mostrar al mundo, y los idiotas que "gobiernan" que la música une al mundo y todos somos hermanos y hermanas.quelque chose doit être fait.nous ne pouvons pas rester là à regarder.une guerre nucléaire aurait des effets catastrophiques.nous parlons de la Troisième Guerre mondiale.deux puissances nucléaires tirent à leur fin pour la même connerie raison à chaque fois: le fric.Je suis juste un homme, mais je ne peux que prier pour vous tous de me rejoindre, prendre les rues et montrer au monde que, peut-être, et un meilleur endroit que ce qu'il paraît, sous le même drapeau arc-en-20 avril nous allons tous dans la rue et de la danse pour montrer au monde et les idiots qui "gouvernent" que la musique unit le monde et nous sommes tous frères et sœurs.något måste göras.Vi kan inte stå och titta på.ett kärnvapenkrig skulle få katastrofala följder.Vi talar om ett tredje världskrig.två kärnvapenmakter är avveckla för samma dumma jävla anledning när: den jävla pengar.Jag är bara en människa, men jag kan bara be er alla att gå med mig, gå ut på gatorna och visa världen att, kanske, och en bättre plats än det verkar, under samma regnbågsflaggan20 april går vi alla ner på gatan och dansar för att visa världen och de idioter som "styr" Den musiken förenar världen och vi är alla bröder och systrar.

A well made mojito is my all time favourite cocktail (and ernest hemingways!) because it ticks all my boxes of what a great drink should be - it's presented amazingly, it tastes incredible and without fail, a night on mojitos will be one to remember!!The balance of mint and zest of lime, kick of rum and the sweetness of the sugar makes it irressistable, and because there are so many variations (like muddling pineapple instead of lime and adding some pineapple juice - my second favourite!!), everyone can find a version that they love, and you can always freestyle and mix it up when you feel like a change - its pretty much impossible to screw up!To make it: muddle a handfull of fresh mint with lime wedges and sugar, then add a little extra fresh lime juice and two shots of white rum. Shake it with ice, then serve it in an highball glass, top it up with soda and pop a lime wheel, swizzle stick and mint on top - tastes insanely good!!

Hey Gelato Messina. Any chance I can swap the 2 x Gelato Class on the 16 June for another date? It was a birthday present for my sister Victoria Uriarte who obviously has her priorities wrong. As if a trip to Barcelona is more important than your gelato???
I know you recently brought out the 'Number 2' peanut butter gelato, choc brownie & caramel swirls but it didn't stay long enough :( please please bring it back so I can buy a big tub or two or even three tubs! It's my absolute favourite & I didn't get a chance to stock up before it disappeared again. Any chance of it coming back soon?
Why did you change your salted caramel/white chic-chip????? It was my favorite and was perfect! It seems like it is now just made using the dulce de leche....I'd love the 'ol bird back in my life :(

53 days away...September 1, 2012 is the start of the 2012-2013 Taiji dolphin drive hunt. Will you help end it?. JUST ONE CALL A DAY. Get up and CALL YOUR JAPANESE EMBASSY. Please make it part of your daily routine. One call per day, Monday-Friday, from now until September 1, 2012.Politely urge them to NOT issue any permits to the Taiji Fisherman's Union for the purpose of the cruel & senseless Taiji dolphin drive hunt that is typically held from September - March (The drive hunt is graphically illustrated in the 2010 Academy-award winning documentary The Cove, starring Ric O'Barry). Ask them to stop permitting harpoon hunting the remainder of the year. If there are no permits, there is no slaughter. It is as simple as that. AND WHILE YOU HAVE THEM ON THE PHONE LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU THINK THE IDEA OF A WHALE PARK IN TAIJI IS TERRIBLE! WHALES & DOLPHINS BELONG IN THER OCEANS - PERIOD!!!

So fucking windy and cold! This is not Summer
Big Wednesday was an epic surf film from 1978. My favourite quote is from Matt Johnson: "I don't wanna be a star, have my picture in magazines, have a bunch of kids looking up to me. I'm a drunk, a screw up. I just surf cause its good to go out and ride with your friends."
Y'know what sucks about living in Bondi... NOTHING. #bondivet #bondirescue #larabingle

Hi QPAC!Ive bought a picnic for two tickets before the Illusionists this coming Sunday. It looks like the weather might be a washout :( Are there any wet weather solutions?thanks :)
Please see if Josh Grobans promoters will consider holding an extra show for Brisbane please ....can't believe I missed out on  tickets :( love you JOSH !!!!
Hi folks!  Dinosaur Petting Zoo advertising flyers are being put on seats ahead of the Hairy Maclary performances.  Despite Dinosaur Petting Zoo being sold out :(  Thought you might like to know.  p.s. Hairy Maclary was fabulous! :)
Thank you QPAC for my tickets to A Royal Affair last night unfortunately I had to work :-(
;-(
Hi QPAC, My mum and dad went to tonight's performance of Jersey Boys and enjoyed the show. However, when they arrived at the Centre they accidentally drove into the wrong car park and were charge $15 to drive around and drive out to go into the correct car park. Is this correct procedure?
Since when it is ok for patrons to be loudly munching on chips and lollies through a theatre show? Way to ruin the experience of seeing A Chorus Line for everyone in the vicinity. 
Is Ed Sheeran going to do a second show? It's sold out! :(
No high tea for the first matinee performance of Alice in Wonderland :-(?
Just saw the last show of Wizard of Oz tonight and have to say it was just FaNtAsTiC.  The girl that played Dorothy did a brilliant job. She sang like her, she spoke like her...was just great. The only thing I was disappointed with was Toto. He looked like a German Shepard puppy nothing like the one in movie :(But just loved it, loved it, loved it. Well done everyone. 
Hey qpac - what went wrong.  I've been trying for 3hrs and NOTHING - ZILCH - ZERO  How come we can't even get one ticket and get the run around from every direction you try!!!
1.5 hours and i still can't get into QPAC to get ed sheeran tickets.  Not exactly impressed, to say the least.:(
Literally been trying to get Ed Sheeran Tickets for 1h 20mins :(
when did the application for the in the box volunteer positions end. Finally got the time to do it and no longer there. =(
Hey Qpac peeps, we have tickets for Wednesday night to see MP. but I'm worried about the seating I got for my mum and I.  Row O.  I'm now told there is a hand rail in front of us....mum is only 5ft.Are we going to be able to see comfortably.  ?? :| Im hoping so much she is comfortable with her hip injury :(
Hi guys, is seating for Bryan Adams just the standard Concert Hall seating? That is, starting at GG? The links to the seating plan from the basket screen aren't working for me, says "failed to load pdf".
Saw Dr. Zhivago on Thursday night. It was amazing. Anthony Warlow never fails to impress. Highly recommend people to see it.On another note, is QI Live coming too Qpac? I read somewhere it was but find no info on the site. Say it is, for I have the biggest crush on Stephen Fry and QI is hilarious.
Is there some way to request Lucy to come to the stage door after Wicked? My friend and I are going to Wicked on Sunday as Elphie and Glinda and we really want to meet her and Jemma, but we heard Lucy doesn't go out anymore :(
Is there something wrong with your phone systems?  Twice I waited for more than 10 minutes only to have an empty line when the phone finally rang
Little frustrated that looking at various comments on the page it seems plenty of peoples seats are now "better" than their original ones. I booked in July and did not receive a call this week, despite it supposed to be happening in booking order, I called yesterday and was quickly told there was only one night I could even get seats in the same section, the final night, 2nd of April...and the seats are worse seats in a different row and further to the side :( If a situation requiring rebooking ever happens again, you really should do it in booking order or not "upgrade" some people and downgrade others. Anyhow, rant over. Am still looking forward to seeing the show final night and am glad at least it's all over and the show is back up and running in the gorgeous theatre!
Hi QPAC I was one of the many affected by Wicked not being able to go due to the floods and I have been waiting for Qtix to contact me re rebooking.  However I have just received an email from preferred seating that mentions new shows just released.  I was just wondering what was happening as I thought all the rebookings were going to be sorted before the extra shows went on sale.If I've got it wrong then I apologizeThanksSandra
Its looking to me like QPAC has overlooked many of the people who booked tickets for Wicked early ie in July though the prerelease allocation. I too booked tickets in July and have not heard from QPAC as yet. Very frustrating while I do what has been requested and not contact QPAC while other people have their new tickets allocated. :(
Are we supposed to be contacting QPAC to be rescheduled or will they contact us?? I haven't heard from them yet! I had tickets to the show 23rd Jan and I booked them within the first 5 minutes of them going on sale the first time. I would be disappointed if somebody that booked weeks after me got better seats :(
I bought my tickets back in July within a couple days of them being released, for 20th Jan show, as a Christmas/Anniversary present for my girlfriend. I've tried to be patient waiting for a phone call, but it's starting to get a bit ridiculous, as neither of us can get through, nor afford to pay an expensive phone bill, just to wait for an hour and be cut off. We've lost hundreds of dollars already from travel and accommodation that had to be canceled. I fear that we won't get to see Wicked now as once the uni starts we wont be able to afford just to travel to Brisbane to see the show. It's hard when you've saved for months just to see your money disappear.I understand the horrendous task of rescheduling, and appreciate all the hard work that all the staff at QPAC/QTIX, but please don't forget us. :(
Anyone know what's happening with Wicked?  Says on the web it's cancelled until 21st but I was told indefinitely.  Haven't seen that in writing anywhere but was told the props were ruined.  Is it going ahead at all?
I normally sit back and just read everybody whinging at each other and don't take too much notice...but this time I can't. I am sick of people on this site telling others that they are selfish for wanting to know about shows being cancelled or being disappointed that they are missing out. We ALL know that there was a flood...75% of QLD was flooded...including the town I live in. We all feel for those affected..however...at the risk of being ridiculed by the people on this site...LIFE GOES ON. People on here have the wrong attitude. We feel for those that have lost loved ones, possessions, houses etc but we don't have to go moping around forever. We can still be happy and we can still look forward to seeing Wicked and doing other things.
Hopefully everthing will be safe and dry by next wednesday. Wouldnt want all the props and costumes to be ruined or wet. We have a group of 23 coming to see the AMAZING Wicked next Wednesday. Fingers crossed! Our thoughts are with everyone at QPAC and involved with Wicked. Stay Safe. 
ouch, on hold to Showbiz to change my tickets after hearing how they are unco-operative, still no answer and they are playing Defying Gravity on the hold music :( 
Probably a stupid question but is the water getting anywhere near the actual theatre in the cremorne or lyric? Would hate to have the sets ruined or the seats. 
Hi I have tickets for tomorrow Tuesday 18th Jan for Wicked and was wondering when I will be able to find out some info about transferring these tickets to another session, I have had my tickets 5 months now and was so looking forward to seeing it tomorrow :(
Missing Wicked tonight :(. Hoping a reschedule is possible rather than having to just get a refund in miss out.  Do you know yet if reschedules are likely?
Hey - are the King Lear tickets really cheaper for people under 30? I wasn't sure at the website when I went to buy them and I don't want to buy the wrong ones.
It is disappointing to know that the Normie Rowe concerts were cancelled. :(
Madame Morrible has truly been at work today, it's a shame their isn't a spell in the Grimmiere to stop this horrible disaster :(
Might be worth letting everyone know if you booked tickets through Showbiz you have to call them...sat on the phone for an hour waiting for Qpac to find this out...now have to wait another hour... :(
I really want to go see mamma Mia with my partner for our anniversary but there's none :( can we will some somehow ?! 
Really disappointed in the whole thing. Was online from 9am for it only to keep crashing or then saying seats available but when i went to put in basket it said it wasnt available. Then to be waiting on the phone for 45mins only to be told there wasnt any left and to keep trying you never know. These are the only services available for the people in the country area's. Carnt understand why there would be only 1 ticket available at a time bit unusual when we tend to go along to these shows with a friend:((
it is so sad that those of us who booked on opening night or the next night will now have to wait longer to see Wicked :( I know it is no-one's fault and it's nothing compared to what other people have gone through and we are very lucky, but one still can't help feeling bitterly disappointed :(
Stuck in flooded Toowoomba. We have tickets for tomorrows show-and we can't get there!!!!! :( Kids and I are all very sad.We can't get through to Qpac, would to know that we can reschedule?????????

I am absolutely appalled with how the NEW market manager is attempting to run the market. Firstly we don't even know his name apparently he doesn't come time to introduce himself to both new and old stall holders. Secondly he has disgusting manners, one of those power people that constantly has to talk over everyone, his answer is the only right answer. Thirdly we have been approved weights on our gazebo three times, by both glen (old market manager) and Steve (second in charge of surfers alliance) but this new  market manager he warned he would give us a breach because he is too lazy too look into it, its ridiculous!  Get your head screwed on mate, because your just as bad as the last one and one more thing "This is my market" from the market manager. reality check we make all your money by selling our stock, so realised that stall holders do have a lot of power when it comes to being treated the wrong way. My mum has not heard the end of it. And ontop of this my grandma, neighbour just died and my nana is on hospital but he has no time or sympathy for anyone who has family issues. 
Perfect Saturday lunch #octopus #tastyshit #saturdaylunch #healthy @indiavail
Best night at surfers dressed like a hobo!! Drank to much at Irish pub, stayed at strip club till 5am, kissed a chick, met my future husband, attempted pole dancing, failed.. Slept in my car (for an hour) then drove back to Brisbane... Night complete <3
You know removing someone's posts because they are critical of your operations is a sign that you know something is very wrong. The fact that your contract with the stallholders is probably illegal for the stall holders to sign, and also that fact being pointed out to you should make any reputable business stand up and take note. Deleting the posts confirms that you only care about company profits. Recent studies of social media in business shows the following:1/. Social media business pages with only complimentary posts are looked upon as being fake.2/. Social media business pages with uncomplimentary posts that are not acted upon are looked upon as being bad businesses.3/. Social media business pages that have uncomplimentary posts but where the business has tried to solve the problem are looked upon favourably.So, where does this place SPA, in the worst category, number 2.The majority of stall holders have valid concerns, concerns that which SPA have either avoided totally, or pulled "big brother" tactics to try and hide the issues. SPA, It's time to create a legitimate bad weather plan. At the moment your contract states that SPA is the sole decision maker as to when bad weather cancels the markets and SPA's decision is final. Also, SPA claims NO RESPONSIBILITY for any damages or accidents that may occur due to bad weather, it is the stall holders responsibility. Also, the stall holder is unable to make a weather decision because we are required to obey SPA directions.Further, the stall holders Public Liability insurance will not cover us if we fail our "Duty Of Care" to the public, therefore we are not insured.These are valid concerns that should be addresses, not deleted....
This does not look inviting this morning!! #morningingrun#bondi#fitfam#getfit#cold#wintersucks

Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me??? Looking a shop that sells those stick on the wall pictures/ blackboard??? Also does anyone know anywhere that sells those shelves that go in a corner but you don't need any screws or damage to the wall??? Thanks. Any help is greatly appreciated
Raining day :(((
Go to Blue Bottle Cafe and order an SG-120. Off the menu. Best coffee in town hands-down.  You won't go wrong w/ cappuccino, espresso, hot chocolate or anything else there either.
At the cookie store if you want to try something a bit different, go for the lime, pistachio and cranberry - so fresh and fruity. For an old favourite, you can't go wrong with the sticky date cookie.
Sales man in level 6 is hopeless... :(
Tomizone not working most of time :(
Can't control urself to stop shopping :-(
Coffee Emporium in food court major fail. Very slow service, coffees ordinary.

A Lifetime Membership costs £50 and then you can watch films for as little as £1.50. We've seen loads of band documentaries in here but we do miss the plush loveseats :(
Gosch Sylt ist ne Frechheit! Scampis (7 Stück!!!) vom Grill 6 €!!! Sorry Gosch! #fail
Ask a friendly local to make sense of sydneys horrible transport maps and service times - catching the wrong ferry can be a time waster.
They won't do peanut sauce on the side... Even after we begged them... :(
Half filled coke that was totally flat :( buy bottled drinks instead...
Sadly they ruin their prosciutto sandwich by adding mayonnaise to it.
What a joke. Who is saying this place is good? Cold food shit coffee. I've left mine unfinished. I'm a big boy and I NEVER do that.
Bring your jacket!! It's freezing, 7 degrees :(
This is the best pizza in SF. And I don't want to hear any shit about Patxi's.
Crappy outdated rooms and a shitty hairdryer
real authentic japanese shops! fuck yes!!
The take away's portion is so much smaller! ;(
Worst lifts ever!!! Slow and long wait. :(
You can't put coins in the machines anymore!!! :(  you need at least $5 note!
Heaps of random shit. But some really good Chinese upstairs at super chef
Hobbyco should be called 'robbyco' :-(
Don't let me put you off this place but these people take five hours to bring the food and are wrong. Gary you wig wearer your fired!!
The service is pretty poor- they brought us the wrong drinks and then forgot our sides. No tip methinks...
For film listings see www.princecharlescinema.com. All other websites (including foursquare) consistently get the films and times wrong.
Terrible customer service. Promised a 3pm check-in. An hour & still waiting... :(
Get the Strawberry Fizz for $2 on Tuesdays. No free fries, though, which is sad because they were yummy.  :(
I've heard they do shit hot creative.
Pity you have to listen to loud bloody shit black music everytime you come in the shop.
Got my parking permit and picked the wrong one up with my car reg lolz from saturday will park there
This theater is dead during weeknights and good luck finding help if something goes wrong. Their 3D is almost never works. I live next to this theater and have no choice so I keep coming back. :(
Try the Prime Fuckin' Rib (via @Foodspotting)
Best coffee in Sydney, only open on weekdays though - flat white and avocado on toast. can't go wrong
The poffertjes here is super awesome but they only sell it on Sunday :(
Convenient just under my apartment. Stupid cashier! Can't event speaks english properly asking me back ' can u speak chinese ' make wrong order. Order COLD herbal jelly came with no ice. Stupid!
coconut mocha w/choc chips + toasted coconut loaf and load that shit up with butter melting omg to die for
You can't go wrong with the $10 Pork Sandwich. I usually don't even eat pork!
These Blaqk Audio guy sucks big time! Go home! The Melbourne band before them were much much better!
Hands down. The worst fucking Bart station.
Кофе холодный, обслуживание долгое...:(
Don't let little idiots on the back sits ruin the movies. Just punch em :)
Thought you'd come for some peace and quiet in the harbor? THOUGHT WRONG.
$49 prix fixe menu on Monday's, and it includes wine! Can't go wrong with that!
Curry up now service sucks big time and they don't seem to care #curryupnow #fail
Terrible service! Got my order completely wrong; had mushrooms when I asked for none because I'm allergic. Didn't ask us what we wanted to drink. & no apologetic jester for getting things wrong. -1
Very mad, I got no helpful service at all and all the assistants seemed to be to busy stairing into space to help me even when I asked >:(
Took a long time to get the drink :|
Check out the #Journeytogreatness T-shirts. Some really good designs! Some are already sold out! :(
You can't go wrong whether iced, hot, espresso, or latte.
Station masters here are unfriendly as fuck. I don't owe them a living.
this place is THE SHIT. we all know about the coffee, but also tasty and well-priced breakfast food. one dish enough to share for a small snack. warning, the water glasses are more like shot glasses.
This place sucks. Always a huge line, the slowest checkers and baggers in the whole city, and lousy help. The Safeway of last resort.
After seven years and countless shows, this venue is just as bad as it has always been. Shit sound, crappy beer, more people than space, and you still don't get your ticket stub back after the show.
Shitty service, long wait, but really good food. Story of San Francisco
They got the order wrong, charged us for their mistake and were unapologetic. Boo. Go to another sushi place.
Can't go wrong with a slider..try the meatball and calamari sliders.
It was amazing. Makes you really think about what happened that day :(
Frustratingly irresponsive screen, sushi roll came with the wrong ingredient. Upset stomach after eating.
Opens at 10:(
Kombucha sucks. Don't buy it, because then you're just THAT girl. Also: don't ever say "namasté." Please.
My most fave bar in SF. Good burgers shitty service epic beer& 420 friendly
this place is a shithole. when you're not being raped by BART's horrendous pricing on tickets - you're being socially harnessed by some homeless dude. take all that and combo it with urine smell.
this place is fucking awful. run for your life
There isn't any vegetarian option :(
Don't bother trying to log in to the "Inlink free wi-fi" in the food court level. It never works :-(

Sometimes having a meeting and discussing stressful shit is easier when it's not in the office. Green Beacon brew house was the  perfect spot.
Be careful not to sit on the silver bollards at the entrance if you have a dog. The security guard will come & tell you to fuck off as you're on Westfield property. He will also try and fight the dog.

"It's a common belief that positive thinking leads to a happier,healthier life. As children we are told to smile,be cheerful and put on a happy face. As adults we are told to look on the bright side,to make lemonade and see glasses as half full. Sometimes reality can get in the way of our ability to act the happy part though. Your hope can fail,boyfriends can cheat,friends can disappoint. It's in these moments when you just want to get real,drop the act and be your true scared unhappy self."

A WARNING FOR FELLOW TRAVELLERSFollowing my recent experience with Qantas losing my baggage on a flight from Honolulu to Sydney, I urge everyone to be aware of the terms & conditions under which Qantas agree to carry your bag:1. Do not under any circumstances put anything in your bag that you can't live without - because they don't give a shit if you lose it and they take no responsibility for not ensuring your bag reaches the same destination you do.2. If they lose your bag they will pay you out a sum total of $1646, regardless of the value of the contents of your bag.3. If you had a bag full of Xmas presents (which I strongly suspect is what made it go 'missing') and have had to replace all the presents at your own cost (on top of original purchase) well that's just your tough luck - again, Qantas don't give a shit.4. If you want to have them investigate further as to where your bag went missing, well, that's just outside the scope of their responsibility. To view the security footage of the bag's progress, you have to contact the Australian Federal Police, who advise you that you have to be able to tell them where the bag was stolen from. So you recontact Qantas and ask them to send you proof of the bag being boarded on the flight and arriving in Sydney and guess what? Nope, they can't do it - I'm STILL WAITING for the evidence - why do you suppose that would be?My bag has now been "missing" for over a month and I have lost any hope of ever seeing it again. I know some scumbag has therefore stolen it along it's path, but will Qantas help me find out who has done this? Nope, I'm on my own. I will not be deterred though Qantas - one way or another, I will find who took my bag and I will not sign your waiver insisting that you have no legal liability and that I must keep my loss confidential. You have to be kidding me - the Australian public need to be made aware of how crap your baggage service is and how completely you wash your hands of any responsibility for ensuring my bag reaches my destination with me. Not only did I PAY you for that service, I have a basic right to the information that will help me find who has disrupted it.Long story short...if you go overseas on a shopping trip, do NOT entrust Qantas with your bag home - get your goods home some other way.
The Great Qantas ripoffBought a return ticket for my partner ,from Bangkok to Sydney at the weekend from Qantas, you can't buy online so you have to use the customer service line, $60 fee, no option, $30 fee to pay with credit card, no option,now the biggest ripoff, spell her name wrong, rang customer service today to change the spelling, $80 fee plus $30 fee again to use credit card ,no option. Last fucking time I ever use Qantas again, Great Australian Ripoff, how fucked has this country become !
$80 charge to change the spelling on a E-Ticket is a fucking ripoff,then to charge $30 again to pay by credit card when there is no other option is a fucking bigger ripoff
What does Gold status get here? Not much really!  Service was; I was asked to go way and call the help desk when the wrong FF # was given to me! Did they try to help? No! 
I usually travel Virgin business for work, but thought I would give Qantas a go. I usually travel qantas economy every third week. When I got my bags, I had my laptop missing, I approached baggage and all they said is that "this just doesn't happen" I went through insurance, they don't cover laptops or cameras. I wrote a detailed email to qantas customer service a few weeks ago and they have failed to respond to my message.  I find it very rude to just ignore emails of that nature.  I know if I was running a business and ignored complaints I wouldn't be in business any longer.
Very disappointed qantas club. I'm at BNE airport and have a gold card. But can't take my family into the lounge . So what us all the hype about getting a piece of plastic that you can't use for your family. :(
I am not a fan of QANTAS but the past few interactions with them has just solidified my stance that QANTAS is now really quite a shit brand!1st/ I flew them to Johannesburg return via Sydney. The ticket that was offered online via their website had me with a change between Domestic > International with 1hr. The plane left left (that happens). When I told the staff where I was flying to the look at me amazed ...one even said " Why did you leave it so short between flights??"..... um because that's what QANTAS offered!!!! The nice Cabin Manager moved me, just before landing, up to the front seat in Business class so I could "run like the wind!" to get through customers in time. ...... NO time to cash in my GST or buy Duty Free!! ....made it...sweaty & puffing!2/ I paid $50 to get the seats I wanted return..... on the way back the plane wasn't full. I counted 15 changes by people...some got full rows to themselves...... ummmm I didn't & I was stuck with a person next to me in a 2 seater..... surely if you can see who's purchased full fares or special menus that you could see who bought seats @ an extra cost & try to accommodate them!!!3/ International staff & their service was pretty mediocre..... domestic was nice4/ QANTAS LOUNGE had a sale on whilst I was away.... it actually was a good price but was only for 3 days.... I decided to bite the bullet & see if they would still allow me to purchase the offer as I was away at the time (having flown them to my destination!) & didn't get the email until after...... they pretty much compared themselves to a clothes shop & said "they wouldn't offer you the item after the sale just because you were away!" ..... umm if they had the technology to see my purchase history & could prove that I was away & used them to be away ...I THINK THEY MIGHT!!!!Unfortunately I am flying them to London return but otherwise QANTAS you can go shove your company up your proverbial!!!

No free wireless in Qantas business lounge. Major fail!
Your points upgrade system sucks!  Tried for two weeks and no seats on a middle of the day flight???
MOOOOOOOOORRREEEEEEEEEE WHISKEYYYYYYYYYY. that fat woman has no underwear on... Also, cheese smells like a manky sock. And I say fuck Wally, who cares where he is, he doesn't want to be found.
I think this is the best terminal in sydney however the toilet sucks!!!

If you like Maccas better over HJ, have some at ther other terminals. There's only Hungry Jacks in here. :-(
Deans given the sack yes thank god lets Ewen Mckenzie we can win the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe cup this year lets prove a lot of people wrong we just need to pick the right squad. please drop Kepu, Douglas (maybe just makes too many mistakes inhand, Saia Faingaa, simmons, Palu, Horne, Barnes. please bring in Toomua, and players like Shipperley, Rod Davies, James Hanson, Pyle, Caderyn Neville and Fardy as well. if it was i would have Sio on the bench ahead of Kepu.
No team in their right mind should retain Robbie Deans.. he has brought Australian Rugby to their knees.. a record to be ashamed of Robbie.. such hope you broke the heart of every Rugby enthusiast in Australia and you dare to not resign in protest for your failure to achieve what was expected of you.. shame on you and shame on considering yourself as a coach.. you could not coach an under 5's team.
FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS I HAVE NOTICED THAT AUSTRALIANS ARE NOT PATRIOTIC TOWARDS THEIR TEAM WHILE PLAYING AT HOME , THIS WAS BASICALLY THE LIONS HOME GAME, WHERE WERE THE AUSSIE VOICE CHEERING THE BOYZ ON , ALL I COULD HEAR WAS LIONS....WHAT WRONG WITH YOU GUYS....
Deans' constant experimenting with out of position players hasn't worked for the last 3 years, why should it work now? It didn't. We failed miserably because we have o'connor out of position. Beale should never have been in the squad, has no respect for the jersey,  his team mates or his country as his and o'connor proved with their hungry jacks stunt. Yet they still get in the squad. Quade Cooper was right, the Wallabies are toxic, and it starts right up the top. Fire the selectors who keep putting in under performing Tahs. Fire Deans who is petty and vindictive, and STOP rewarding players who continually do the wrong thing with starting positions. Stop spending money on league players. Start spending money on players who respect the jersey, who work hard, and care about rugby as a sport: Liam Gill, Jesse Mogg, etc - These are the players of the future, and the ones who will end up bringing crowds, results and respect back to the Wallaby jersey. One that's been trashed under Deans' tenure. 
Dear Wallabies Selectors.How can you leave Liam Gill, the future of Australian Rugby out of the team, little own the squad. In doing so you have taught future Wallabies that it is ok to play overseas until they are ready for retirement, then swing on home to play for the Wallabies in the "important matches ( WC, Lions).I would now not be surprised if we lost Liam Gill to France as his Wallaby dreams could quite likely be shattered for this irresponsible selection of George Smith.Dont get me wrong, I love the man and what he has done for Rugby. We have potentially now lost a young man that has soo much more to offer the ARU to overseas.It is a real shame.GO THE WALLABIES!
I write this on behalf of the whole Australian rugby community.It has been a while since someone has applauded the actions of Cricket Australia as a business model, however, yesterday CA made a choice that should be mimicked around the nation. Yesterday the South African head coach of the Australian cricket team was rightly sacked as CA duly realised a local leader was needed. I, along with the rest of Australia feel the ARU need to take note of these actions and apply the same stance to our beloved Wallabies. While in 2007 it may have seemed like a fantastic and intelligent idea, we have failed to see Deans match the accolades he reached while in Canterbury. This begs the question why haven't the Wallabies done as well as the Crusaders under the same leadership? Clearly the cattle comes to mind at first, however, while this may have been plausible during his first contract, we have seen a significant resurgence in Australian talent with a team that has the ability to be certain world beaters. We - the Australian public - feel it is right to now ask why aren't we world beaters or even challenging for the position??The answer is simple, Robbie Deans isn't one of us. Not only has this man coached throughout the enemy or played for the enemy, he has black blood all through his veins. It is time the Deans experiment is put to bed and the reigns be taken by someone that is as Aussie as Lamington's and Don Bradman.So please ARU, regardless of the results in this Lions tour, or in the following Rugby Championship, do what is right for your country. It is time to respectfully and mutually part ways with our resident All Black and put the nations best interests at the forefront. We thank Deans for his efforts, regardless of how clueless he has been but it is time he returns to sheep country. Yours sincerely, AUSTRALIALex Dracakis
I have just posted this on my Facebook.Okay - I've had enough!If you want to play for your country in a sport - you should be made to learn your national anthem!! Team after team are focused on by world television and there they are mumbling away, looking around or mouthing the wrong words. Jeez - you are playing for your country - is it too much to ask? Ok - now I feel better.Even if they all stood silently but reverently, it would look better!  Come on Australia – lift the world game!
Who does that dinosaur Clark think he is to say about Brian O'Driscoll and I quote "hes played a bit of rugby so he thinks he knows the law", if the same calls so far has been made against the Aussies Clark would have gone of his nut at what a bad call it was. Come on Aussies I thought we were the leading country in sportsmanship, apparently I was wrong.
What an embarrassment, Horwill not only stamped, but has compounded that with his scandalous explanation, which could not be disproved. I'm all for a bit of shoe if a blokes on the wrong side but not on the taffys head, come on play fair guys.

"Qantas Wallabies Advance Ticket Offer" was a complete #fail. Emails did not contain passcode - only MyRugbyId. I am not the only person who was unable to process the offer. Please repeat it as soon as possible
maybe instead of selecting a team in future the ARU could give the vocal minority there birth given right and allow them to insert there favourites regardless of team dynamics. once upon a time (lets call it now) a coach was appointed and then selected the players to which he could rely to execute a game plan he best felt could win the series. these days were replicated through every team throughout time in every sport ever. sure there were occasions when cashed up owners would buy players and insist there use but at the core of any team the selectors would pick the team based on experience & understanding beyond a dude with a twitter or facebook account. these days are over, now if you don't pick quade cooper no matter your reason, you are wrong. quade should be selected for every game no matter his ability, form, commitment or temperament. if you don't pick quade cooper and rest assured ARU, we are serious, we will bitch and complain like spoiled lactating orphan inbred babies (or in layman terms "qlders") honestly people. the whole quade thing is past its used by date, 25 guys have been chosen, a lot of guys have missed out and your petty BSing about 1 player is taking the spotlight off the 25 who have a right to be proud, humbled and honoured to wear our countries jersey. how about you start your own page called "nobody gives a whoot" and bitch about quade there. 
Super Rugby Team of the Week – Round 115. James O’Connor – Although it was difficult to look past Jesse Mogg’s try-double, the Rebels fullback looked the better all-round player and with a 100% kicking record, who wouldn’t want him in your team.14. Richard Kingi – Playing on the wing for the Rebels, the versatile busy body was all over the park and although he misses more hits than he makes, he is a strong runner and flamboyant finisher.13. Mitch Inman – Nothing much happened in the 13 jersey and the only thing that lifted the Rebels centre’s mediocre performance above that of the rest, was his ability to pilfer the ball a couple of times. 12. Kyle Godwin – Much to the disappointment of many fantasy managers, Christian Lealiifano’s had a very bad day with the boot and although Godwin only had a 50% success rate and Lealiifano being the better defender, the Rebels midfielder kept to opposition quite busy.11. Alfie Mafi – Undoubtedly the shiniest star of Round 1. Not only did he clock the most running meters, besides O’Connor, but he broke through several tackles, and dotted down twice – even though his efforts were  in vein and not enough to change the fate of the Force.10. Quade Cooper – Another area of mediocrity which forced me to choose the Reds flyhalf even though he had a scarcely above average game compared to his own high standards. He is not big on tackling though and my midfield now looks rather vulnerable. They’ll be dangerous on attack though and should just keep possession of the ball.9. Nic White – Will Genia is by far the best Australia has to offer in the halfback department and as he did not play, I had to go with the only other option on display. His useful boot saved Lealiifano from further embarrassment, helped the Brumbies secure their first win and therefore edged him ahead.8. Gareth Delve – The Rebels skipper was as rock solid as always. He carried the ball well, put the tackles in and led by example. Mention must go to Richard Brown for the immediate impact he made; in the 20 minutes he spent on the field he threatened the defense on a couple of occasions and scored a try.7. Liam Gill – Although David Pocock surely made his presence felt during his Brumby debut, the ever improving Reds flanker was as much of a nuisance, but carried the ball better and with more force. 6. Angus Cottrell – This hardworking backrower has a habit of making the most of every opportunity he gets and yet again showed how he thrives on contact situations. 5. Luke Jones – This young Rebel followed his breakout season up with a strong start to the 2013 season. His versatility makes him hard to replace and he didn’t put a foot wrong in the season’s first match.4. Hugh Pyle – His exceptional understanding of the line-out and formidable presence makes this blossoming second rower an asset for any team. He rarely misses a tackle and his strong ball carrying skills managed to get him across the chalk line once again.3. James Slipper – The Reds’ tighthead prop just managed to edge out Tatera Faulkner as he is a more concrete option on defense.2. Ged Robinson – It isn’t every day that you see Stephen Moore take the backseat, but even without taking into account his 5-pointer, the Rebels hooker made his presence felt right across the park.1. Greg Holmes – There was really nothing in this decision as none of the loosehead props did anything to write home about. Forced to choose between Greg and Pek Cowan, I opted to flip a coin. 
I was listening to Ray Hadley this morning, and I quite like his show, and then he bagged rugby AGAIN, not that they had done anything wrong, he was saying some league players who were in trouble (AGAIN)should be playing rugby. I have been listening to him, on and off for awhile and there are always off the cuff comments about rugby. The silly thing is rugby isn't doing anything wrong. So I sent an email to 2GB telling them I was sick of hearing him bagging Rugby. I still can't believe he commentated tests lasts year.Anyway I think more people should say the same things, like his show but why bag rugby.
Hey I'm from Cape Town and I would just like to know where I can get the Wallabies jersey ? I've been searching high and low but I just can't find a shop selling it :(I want to show my support by wearing it at each game you play and I wanna wear it when you play against the Boks in September :) And I would love if the whole team could leave their signature on it If you can help just let me know pretty please !!! 
It should be Deans that is leaving not QC!!! Get your ****ing heads into gear!!! Sorry admin people but pass this up. So sick of Robbie Deans incompetence's it's not funny. ARU is ruined cause of deans, again 3 years I have been saying it, check my posts! Well done, well done.
Watching this game against the All Blacks, I would like to say that this is the worst ref I have every seen, in any sport, he is bias, and obviously bias. I'm not saying the Wallabies are shit, I'm saying, this ref is an idiot.
Great effort on saturday gents. It wasnt the best game but i was impressed by the ticker on display. Now for my whinge...the aru needs to focus on country rugby. We are in a zone that is craving for support yet we have one development officer and in the same zone the afl has 7 staff, and this is in nsw.We have no money we always hear up here, well thats just plain bullshit. Other countries are doing fine so if we are spending too much on elite players get rid of them. If you channelled some of this money to country rugby you will get more players to choose from and you can afford to let go those who are just chasing money. the end result is you will end up with a team who wants to represent australia for all the right reasons.i could go on, your welcome to call me to discuss
My ngame is the QANTAS Wallabies,I cheat and take cheap shots at Mr McCaw because I can't hack losing to the All Blacks. Oh did I mention we take New Zealand players, e.g Quade Cooper. BUT,did I mention,we can't win without th refs help. Sorry Australia,we don't mean to be so shit.
i remember when I use to watch rugby matches that weren't determined by damn penalties goals. the sport is losing thousands of fans to shit like AFL! speak to the international committee and make penalty goals worth less or make a new rule, DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THE GAME MORE EXCITING AND WORTH PAYING FOR!
Honestly, who was the bellend who signed over television rights to Channel 9? First we had the shitty last games during the world cup and now the NRL gets preference again. Please award the next contract to someone who actually wants to televise live rugby, for the good of the game.
Appalling work Channel 9.  The coverage of the Wallabies v Springboks game on Saturday night had less production value than a student radio programme.  One might assume that since you couldn’t manage to show the game Live that you may have been able to squeeze the 8 to 10 different sponsors into the game without ruining the footage.  Apparently this was too much to expect from the work experience boy that you had on the panel Saturday night.  Instead, we got to watch several minutes of “Antique Roadshow” while god knows what happened on the field to the national representative team.  Soon after realising that he/she had gone to the wrong feed, Junior in charge of production thought that playing some camp 80’s synth pop music to accompany the commentators and men of rugby might help make up for the boo boo.  No.  It did not help.This week’s delayed coverage of the game left me disappointed at first, until I realised that the delay would allow you to keep selling advertising access on your professional media network without having it randomly inserted at inopportune times.  Like last fortnight’s game against the All Blacks when coverage of Australia’s attack some 20 minutes into the game had to be interrupted so Tom bloody Waterhose could tell me how much he admires the sports heroes of the nation.  I had hoped that the hour and 15 minute delay would provide the opportunity to plan for these naming vultures to have their say without depriving the viewing loyal fans of the AUSTRALIAN Wallabies of the game.  Sadly, the time clock in the top of the screen and giant jumps between areas of the field, and team possession seem to indicate that this task was simple too much for our Certificate  1 media production graduate.In years gone by I have accepted Wolf Blass, Vodafone and Qantas  etc as sponsoring partners because they support the game and do not detract from my enjoyment of the game – even buying products because of that supportive relationship.  You may have missed the key point there Wired World of Sports: they didn’t ruin the enjoyment of the game.  You are ruining the footage and the enjoyment of the game.  As such this is now negative advertising – I know the brands and will actively avoid their products wherever possible.  I understand that the potential loss of one customer will have the multi million dollar industry quaking in their boots – but this, internet one click activism and bad mouthing your ineptitude is all that we have available to us. Seriously.  Your inability to cover even the most simplistic sporting event is embarrassing.  That’s why I’ve also sent this letter to channel 7, channel 10, SBS, Fox, the ABC, the Wallabies and every other person or organisation that I know will have the decency to shake their collective heads and wonder.  How did channel 9 screw that up so badly?Yours sincerely hoping that Channel 10 put in a better tender next round,Gareth Welsh
Soon the Wallabies will be ringing Brisbane Brothers U15's for replacements...as there'll be more injured than fit players in the squad...:-(
11 years..... :-(It's all gone bad since the ARU stopped promoting Brumbies coaches to the Wallabies.Oh, that and being a previously in form player, especially if you play for the Horratahs..... Form CLEARLY doesn't mean getting a run.
Attention Wallaby supporters in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Tassie we won't get to see the next Wallaby match live next Saturday (KO about 5PM Adelaide time, please do you local adjustments) because that brilliant Rugby broadcaster Channel 9 is going to broadcast the replay at 11:30PM(local time). ANOTHER EPIC FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As a massive Wallabies fan (yes, I even travelled from Melbs to Newcastle to get drowned at the Svcotland game) I am devastated that once again, channel Neine are screwing most of the country over AGAIN by not broadcasting the game.  Don't be sad though, there's a new episode of Getaway on instead and an old Western on their other channel. Channel Neine does NOT support the Wallabies, but I do.GO Fellas, Richie's cheating has been well and truly exposed and it's time to take back that cup.
Hahaha trust you bunch of fucking whining bitchs to put the blame on a world class coach instead acknowledging superior talent and skill in every aspect of the game since the get go all blacks all day ery day bitches
Rejection doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough...It means some failed to notice what you have to offer I fall, I rise, I make mistakes, I live, I learn, I've been hurt but I'm stronger, I'm human, I'm not perfect, but I'm thankful. Again and again, i will keep repeating it :have faith on this !c",)  Proud supporter of the  Wallabies One Team. GOOD LUCK BOYSS...   
Yet again fans in Perth get screwed with free to air coverage by Channel 9. 11pm replay, 7hrs delayed, according EPG on my tv it's not on GEM.
Love afternoon rugby but why o why was the SFS so disorganized? 40 mins to get from bloody gate G to gate K as we had to go back around the stadium through thousands of others, a really dangerous situation. lots of crying kids, worried parents and had it not been for a sensible crowd could have been disastrous. We missed the anthems and first 20 minutes despite getting through main gates at 2.30:( Rant over but something has to be sorted out for next time.
Qantas wallabies please help me.1 - my twitter isnt registering points on rugbyrewards anymore :(2 - i have etickets that won't except bar codecheers
I can't seem to be able to add to my RugbyRewards tally. I know that Castrol EDGE Golden Suit is one of the answers to a hint, but my tweeting and posting aren't working. Am I doing this wrong?
I bought my tickets yesterday through ticketek what an absolute pain in the arse, can't send them in email form or to a P.O Box but yet send them to a house letter box - that's $250 bucks I won't get to see, also $7 plus to pick them up from the box office and if you don't have credit cards like myself then, to pick them up you need that as I.D. I think you need to revise the way you guys do your business cause for the price that we are paying for the tickets then fees on top you can't send them to P.O Boxes as registered mail - way safer btw and signed for, imagine your $250 just put in the letter box for any one to grab. Same price as normal mail. I think it's a joke cause I buy my Reds tickets and it's sent out via email also my last Wallabies tickets were sent out via email, why not the same now? I could of used any ones credit card and have them sent out?.. See where you guys are going wrong? I think you need to fix this ASAP. Thought I would share this with you cause I know I'm not the only one stuck in this situation. Cheers Josh 
What a pity that those of us in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth won't get to see the Bledisloe game live. We get to see the game AFTER the players have returned to their hotels. ANOTHER EPIC FAIL BY CHANNEL 9 AND THE ARU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watching the 9 broadcast I was disgusted to see MY national team has an official betting partner. Abysmal. Appalling. Just plain ordinary. My "insert brand" Wallabies now have a betting partner. How low will you debase them? Disgusting. I'll bet 20 cents you won't put this on the wall. Prove me wrong. 
Rugby Rewards not accessible from my phone - iPhone4 - when at the game.  Using Facebook for iPhone you would expect to be able to at least Check In to the Rugby Rewards section.  Take a look through my posts/timeline and you will see that I was there.  Please fix it up before the next game.  Lots of us want to engage with you but failures like this make it difficult to keep the faith.  Makes me a feel a bit like the Waratah supporters I suppose :-)
please tell me that one of our 16 free to air TV channels is telecasting the game live in Brisbane? can't see it advertised anywhere :(
Feels sorry for Quade, after a shit of a game last week and now getting injured on the last game of RWC11, hope you have a speedy recovery
wallabies we are.still strong n gold.lets do it for us.for our fans.team and country.we are the wallabies.we cant live for rugby when we aint as one team.so i pray to God to allow ans bring as one.go strong.move on,know right from wrong.are we losers.NO.WHY.CAME THIS WEEKEND WE GONA PROVE OUR WORTH..GO WALLABIESSSSSSSS
Well done Wallabies for finishing 3rd at the WORLD CUP and in the prosess beating the Welsh awesome stuff just a bit of badnews :( seeing COOPER gettin hurt with a bad injury, I really hope he will recover as soon as possible GO WALLABIES GO you guys rock!!! Im truly behind you AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE oi oi oi!!!
The All Blacks desperation to win the RWC has brought out the most appallingly bad sportsmanship from the New Zealand public and press. If it's ok to boo and ridicule players both on and off the paddock & while attempting a shot at goal or trying to catch a high ball, would it be considered wrong to boo while the haka is being performed? I think not.. Quade was singled out and psyched out by a really ugly and bitter campaign and unfortunately  i think it actually worked in the end. So yes the All Blacks played their best game ever greatly assisted by and ugly and unsportsmanlike campaign.. the NZ Public should be ashamed of themselves. Go the Walabies and GO FRANCE!
Dear Quade Copper (: So ths is how it went ! I didn't like you cos you were a wallabie (sorry), then i liked you cos you had the HOT LOOKS ;) then i REALLY DIDNT LIKE YOU, cos you stood in our RICHIE MCCAWS face then i like you cos everyone elses started HATING ON you :( Knnw i've made up my mind I LIKE YOU <3 Maan, im sorry for what happened to your knee dude, kindr feel your pain (have knee injuries my self) . Just wanted to say CONGRATULATION FOR THE BRONZE MEDAL!! And all the best for you, your knee & your rugby career. Oh & you have gorgous eyes. And i dont thnnk your a traitor at all. You moved to Aussie when you were 13, thats like 10 yrs ago ( And yes i did my researce lol) :L ALL the BEST from an ALLBLACK FAN (& now a little bit of a Wallabies too)P.S Qantas Wallabies get ths message across to Quade Copper somehow. <3 you QC 
piss weak peformance doubt i could watch another game, didn't do our country any pride played like a bunch of girls have a good look at yourselves no doubt u have lost a few supporters with that effort. rugby union in austrailia is going to shit wake up austrailia im one very disappointed fan
Devo we lost but proud as of our team, I will support u whether u win or lose! I just wanna say to Quade Cooper u helped us get where we are today and ur a real asset to our team and we are lucky to have u! I cannot believe the shit you've coped from AB supporters because u choose to play for Australia funny how the other 4 Maori/islander players don't get called traitors but u do..Pretty unfair, total bullshit! O'Connor your a legend, I can't believe someone so young has so much talent. In the end we just didn't play our best tonite and when u meet the All Blacks u can't play any less than ur best or u have a result like tonite. 
Shit you know what after listening to the Wallabies Captain and Robbie Deans they both gave big credit to the All Blacks and at the end of the day accepted the fact that we played a better game and said we deserved the win...a humble defeat Wallabies boyz but at the end of the Rugbys the winner.

I think the Wallabies got there tactics all wrong... why were we trying to slow the ball down all game? But it doesnt help when you have a Southern Hemisphere ref scared to penalise the AB's at the breakdown. Not enough hunger and passion and would have helped with the best players in form, Scott Higginbotham and Beau Robinson... poor selection choices. McCalman shouldnt have been there either. Unlucky Wallabies next World Cup 
- HAHAHA ; All Blacks carved it up beh , Quad Cooper you played shit mateee , pick up your balls fellas ' we owned yous ( : , YEAHHHH BUDDYYYY !
Poor little wallabies :((( eat my dust kids.....my boys are on the way to the final!!!!!!! We'll think of you when we're holding the cup high n proud....bet you wished you were you wearing the black n white now quadey boy! 
Lads, huddle round. There might be tens of thousands black jerseys in that stadium tonight and you might be in a country where you're surrounded by millions of All Blacks supporters. However, remember that for every time the crowd seems like they are urging you to fail, there will be more than 20 million folks across the ditch in gold jerseys willing you that every bit closer to the ultimate success. So go lads and bring home Bill to where it rightly belongs.
haha u watched the ref fuck the boks last weekend and allowed pocock to play an illegal game, now the SOUTH AFRICAN ref is going to fuck you in the semi's by nailing pockock every chance he gets.... FUCK YOU!!! 
shame wales are out :(...would have been a good final with allblacks and the welsh.....now we gotta walk ova aussie and france......YAWN
The All Blacks will rock some kangaroo dome tonight. pack up your shit Aussie tourist your heading home on the same plane. yee buddy!
Wales Wales Wales oh so close soooo devastated you had all the chances in the world you didn't take it....loosing it by one point such a piss off bloody France didn't deserve to win that game they played so bad not even funny...well? gota give to the frogs they won...good luck to The All Blacks & The Wallabies tomorrow may the best team win...who ever that may be i hope you beat the shit out of France they dont deserve to be in the finals...All Black supporter and a soft spot for The Wallabies
Dear wallabies. As a South African, I really hate use for beating us last weak :(. BUT I will hate use 1 000 000 times more if use allow the All Blacks to take this world cup. GO WALLABIES. I'm routing for use on sunday

It makes me vomit when i see islanders born and raised in oz follow all blacks esp because all blacks have a lot islanders! Back your country australia or get the fuck out! aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi!! 
Well done our men in green and gold. Great game, minor heart failure but great game. Looking forward to you snotting the All Blacks next week. Go Wallabies go!!!!!!
Carter out, Slade out, Muliaina out, McCaw on one leg... the Wallabies have a guardian angel for sure! Beale is a worry though without Mitchell to cover:|
Awesome win boys, although not the best performance, please learn from mistakes, fix the line-out, that should have been better in the 2nd half, but you came out with the same plan, and it was wrong....you must see that!!GO WALLABIES!!!
why the hell is the admin of this page sayin congrats to the all blacks ? just cause yr a kiwi dont bring that crap to this page admin, go post that on all blacks page, we dont wanna congratulate them ?? we wanted them to fail
It's funny how there are some shit people like for example, 'Bok supporters' say we paid Bryce Lawerance, learn to watch rugby more than 3 times a year and it will show you, he is just a shit house ref. EAD you sore losers. UP THE WALLABIES!!!

I think leaving Matt Giteau out of the squad was ssooooo wrong Quade is a great player just to unpredictable, he's had a mistaken ridden tour so far ' Will Genia is the most outstanding player for OZ!!!!
We are behind you all the way boys - easy for the armchair sportsman who are happy to tell you where you went wrong, none of it matters. Just stay focused and do your best - true Wallabies supporters will continue to support you no matter the outcome of the RWC. Go Qantas Wallabies!! We think you're great!
Being a proud kiwi and all blacks supporter, I am disgusted at some of the behaviour my fellow kiwis have inflicted on the Wallabies supporters, i think this has gone way to far, while there is nothing wrong with some friendly competiton i think that yelling inappropriate abuse, spitting have crossed the line and im so embarrassed by my fellow kiwi's behaviour. NZ is the host country we are meant to welcome everyone to our amazing country i dont think anyone deserves to be treated this way being from Australia or not.... All blacks supporters keep your negative comments off this page. Remember its still anyones game while im hoping it wont be an Aus - NZ final, anything can still happen!!! but go the all blacks and i wish the Wallabies the best for the rest of their RWC campaign.
Why is there a bigger mongoloid version of that tosser first 5 from Canberra as your profile picture? He's not even in the squad.Also, Robbie Deans dropped Christian Cullen, now he's ruining your team.Get rid of him.Go the all blacks!
Robbie deans you are a disgrace, and your career should survive only marginally longer than Ben McCalman and Bryce Lawrence who should already be on planes to a Siberian gulag! Lost all interest... Haven't watched a single second of football since Saturday and have lost all motivation to follow the stupid fucking tournament... Even if they win it I'm not sure I will ever forgive the shame, disappointment and embarrassment of such a disgracefully inept performance by a shit team and an imposter of a coach. Lost all interest in sport, think I'll take up roller blading, or something else overtly gay. Deans your an ass-clown, you chose Patrick phibbs and no reserve openside? You chose McCalman over higginbotham? You left faingaa on the field for 2 weeks longer than his international career should have ever gone for... then pulled Samo and Vickerman off when the forwards were being outmuscled??? What fucking game were you watching you fucking kiwi stooge! It has conspiracy written all over it!
Go the Wallabies, you can do it. Bring home the World Cup and prove the doubters wrong. Get behind the Wallabies everyone, they need your support. FmG.
You ozzies ask for it ay, you make fun of our haka on triple m, rove tells jokes "Wat do you call an irish man beaten by a wallabie"? "well find out tonight" well you got owned by the underdogs, thats kama your in a spiritual country with mana its just your kama wallabies,. doint get me wrong i love living in au but you have no fucken sportsmanship or respect, fuck stephine rice and suck on that faggots!
it was a really disappointing result over the weekend but tht doesn't mean  the cup is out of our reach ...it would be really nice if all the negative from last game can be turned in to positive in the next game and bring Webb Ellis Cup where is belong...we all are standing next to u all through out... SUCCESS IS THE ONLY OPTION, FAILURES NOT.... Wallabies. Wallabies. Wallabies.oi oi oi
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Level-of-1-Quade-Cooper-how-shit-are-you-at-playing-rugby/270495396300263?notif_t=page_new_likes
Shittest game I have ever seen. You blokes should be ashamed. I don't know what game you were playing out there, it definitely was NOT rugby. 
Rugby is different.....Rugby is passion and pain....Rugby is happines and sadness...Rugby is life.... Rugby is joy.And above all rugby is not fuckin' soccer!!!!Tomorrow our adventure will begin against Wallabies.Do not forget your alarm clock,game will begin on 05,30 am.Our main goal will be reaching the quarterfinals but it will be very hard and tough.Anyway,we must do it.Ok,enjoy and have fun......GOD BLESS ITALY.......C'MON ITALY.......FORZA AZZZZUUUURRRRRIIIII!!!!!!!!
Sekope Kepu, Saia &Anthony Fainga'a, Tatafu Polota Nau, Wycliff Palu, Salesi Ma'afu - Avenge this opening day for me lol....Graham Henry and co looked ill after the Tongan game. They failed to strike fear into the big nations, heck they failed to strike fear into some minnow ones too...
is anyone else pissed at the dismal coverage of the RWC2011 from channel 9. totally ruined my RWC experience. from what i've read channel 9 wants to push only for NRL and wipe rugby union out of australian market. fight for the love for rugby and union on free-to-air. Join petition ""Channel 9 Rugby World Cup Coverage Sucks!!"
Mandatory New Zealanders Commentators contract:* Never malign AB players. If something goes wrong it was just made a mistake, blame the opposition.* AB players do not kick the ball out on the full, it was just caught by the wind.* AB players do not miss shots a goal, misses are due to tectonic movement causing goal posts to move.* AB players are never offside especially Richie McCaw, he's just playing the game.* Referee calls against the AB's are fine unless we're behind on the scoreboard.* AB players never cheat at the break down (especially Richie McCaw.)* Only call a game from the AB's perspective, the other side is only there to make up the numbers.* Never refer to anything to do with a sheep when mentioning Israel Dagg.
Kick quade Cooper off he is an arrogant asshole who needs shooting! By the way he should take those tatts off he ain't a Fucken kiwi u price of shit!!!!!!! Good effort from the rest of the wallabies! Well done 
qantas wallabies is fuckin' bullshit people!!! it's the fuckin' WALLABIES!!! fuck off qantas and your bullshit sponsorship. take your bullshit offshore, just like your maintenance and your crew.
What is wrong with this team's management?  After the tragic house fire in Brisbane, I would have thought an arm band OR a minute before the game would have been nice.
fuck you australians are the biggest bunch of loosers ever... how is doing the haka an unfair advantage..next thing you'll be saying the all blacks shouldnt play at home anymore because they have more fans there.. you lost deal with it... you did loose because we did the haka you lost because your team is full of pussy's... stop moaning and just man up...your jersey should be pink all you lot do is moan like a lil bitch.... its unfair, there too old, its the coaches fault, its your players they are shit
Channel 9 (although is my favorite station) sucks at Rugby Coverage! Long ads during a break in play, then we miss the next period in play!! Surely a series of short "impact" ads 5, 10, 15 seconds only would work. The missing of the start of the second half is a complete stuff up from ch 9!!!
What is this shit:http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&objectid=10744844
Ah hahahaha. Cooper is a lil bitch. Deans you can keep him as a coach and the rest of the Ozzie team is also shit why did you even send anyone to nz. Oh yeah all that bullshit talk from kefu and the rest of Ozzie gunna win my ass. All they do is talk FUCKEN USLESS
Wrong flag apols but the Aussie one is there to buy http://www.flagearrings.co.uk
I ONLYLIKED THIS PAGE TO LET YA'S KNOW HOW MUCH  THE BLACKS ARE GONNA DOMINATE... ALL BLACKS ALL FUCKIN DAY BABY !!!!
just heard what kefu said about the ALL BLACKS... fuckin homos you ozzies gunna loose again but youd be used to it by now
ok if someone out there can tell me that was a good ref performance and be 100% truthful about it.....i dont know what ill do, cos he was shit both ways. please tell me my house isnt the only one who thought this was the case?
Just interested to know how many others don't think Quade Cooper is good enough to play for the wallabies against world class opposition. Just isn't anywhere near the class and brilliance of Wilkinson and Carter. Both brilliant when attacking and in defense! (something Quade doesn't really seem to do or seem to want to do - not good enough attitude for a supposed world class international player!)Don't get me wrong I don't hate the boy, when his risky passes work he is exciting and brilliant but it pains me how other players have to pick up his defensive responsibilities and that silly pass to James O'Connor right on the try line.... OH DEAR! lucky boy!
Cant believe the amount of one eyed Reds on here. Samoa played with alot more intensity. It wasnt a bad loss, only 9 points. It happens. We have just come out of Super Rugby and had 4 debuts. Cant be expected to play like a long form team. And for the record you Cooper fanboys, he would have shit himself. He is scared of tackling and being tackled, the Samoan's would have targeted him all game.
Channel 9 can delete our comments but we still want to watch the Wallabies live in Melbourne - Narrow world of sports...broadcast fail
Isn't it ironic how islanders of all breeds that call our country, Australia home are the first ones to slag shit on any Australian sporting team when they lose. Funny thing is us Aussie tax payers pay their dole so either join us or Fuck off back to your own war torn, 3rd world country! And get a Fuckin job!
Why the hell is higgers not in the team??? Why the f is gitteau still there???? So many good players in the squad ..... Why are they picking the way they are??? Very political ... Argh!!! Come on boys, prove me wrong with this team!! 
HELP : okay so i have 2 tickets to Springboks vs Aussie on 23july. iv got tickets and plane tickets booked. i really need someone to come with me . so if your keen let me know, although please be 18 and an alcoholic, and u need atleast $180 for ticket name change and accomodation, pretty good deal. so get inboxing. i really dont give a shit who u are. just come..ps im in brisbane

You can say watever you want bt the Springboks rules the world! So jst try to focus on ur preparation for the upcoming Tri Nation. U fucken Wallabies *shit*
Well the ARU has done it again because of THEIR weak approach in promoting the game, Rugby supporters in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth are stuck with a broadcast of the Wallabies game on Sunday at 11:30pm. Those of us on low incomes struggle to make ends meet and we cannot afford bloody Foxtel. God knows when we'll get to see the Tri-Nations matches. The channel has changed but Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth still get screwed by TV Execs!
Giteau you are no fucking quade Cooper...stop doing fancy shit you idiot! This is a joke...at least the reds are on the field in force and kurtley Beale!!
gah why do you persist on calling yourselves the QANTAS Wallabies. you represent Australia not an airline. its a disgrace to sell out your own country and heritage. :( 
This is a great video clip of why it's been going wrong for Quade in defencehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUl4wl3bJt0&feature=player_embedded

Deans is no doubt the best coach in the world and he is building this team extremly well for the world cup but the players are constantly screwing things up. Gits is awesome but he needs to stop being so dam aragent and pull his finger out ...of his arse and start playing rugby which makes him the best in the world. Quade your amazing on attack but you need to learn how to tackle, teams are just running rings around him. And please someone learn how to kick we have lost countless games in the last two years because we have missed 3+ kicks every game which equals a min of 9points per game how many games have lost by margins closer than this? i would say most. The incompetence of the players to build on there skill set once the players mastered there defenense they lost there attack once they mastered the scrums they lost the lineout and now that they have mastered their attack they have lost there defense. Sort your shit out Wallabies!
aussies were shit tonight, with the word shit being an understatement. they looked like a bunch of kids playing touch footy, and lucky there were only a few scrums or we would have been really embarressed. o'connor is not a distant kicker (take note robbie deans), and we should know when to kick for goal and when to go for the five pointer. if we play like this during rwc we will be the laughing stock of world rugby which makes my blood boil.
Go you good thing.... love you walllabies...in Western Australia.... in a pub with 3 Ausssies and 500 All Blacks.......Heard about it for 79 minutes........ Oh what a kick   ... James..... You fuckin Little beauty....... Guess what   ......6 people left in the pub....... Bring on the World Cup....... GO YOU GOOD THING!!!!!!!!!!
Geez those dam Kiwis sure are giving us a hiding at team sports at the moment. Bloody Rugby League world champs, kicking us in the rugby all the time, being the only team at the soccer world cup not to lose a game, their women winning the woman rugby world cup, beating us in the netball to win gold and beating us in the 7's. Lucky they don't play AFL or they will probably win that to.  I remember when we could play sport now the Kiwis dominate. We even lost the bloody ashes to the pommies, just lost to the Indians,  are ranked below england and are just about as shit as the kiwis at cricket nowadays. Farout this sucks . :(
Please dump Gits as first choice kicker. Possibly as 1st choice inside centre too.Giteau has made too many costly misses. If you repeatedly fail to take advantage of the opportunites the All Blacks give you, you repeatedly fail to win!
Can u please tellme why on earth quade Cooper is still playing for Australia, he is a shit as kicker and he dosent know how tackle... sorry but I am not going to be jumping on the band wagon any time soon...
Now I've got a clear head, here's a quick thought on the game. This game was close, not just on the scoreboard but pretty even playing wise as well, the reason the Wallabies lost is they failed to capitalize on their kicking.Now I'm not going to blame Giteau for that, yes he was having a bad night, but he hasn't been kicking that spectacular lately anyway. After he pulled that second kick to the right a decision should have been made to pull him and put someone else up to do the kicking. It was pretty clear this was going to be a close game and waiting for Giteau to get his kicks right cost potential points.Moving forward the Wallabies are going to have to look past Giteau and Cooper for their kickers, and should now starting putting O'Connor up as the primary kicker and Beale as his backup when required. They both have a lot more years in them and both are playing and kicking well.Anyways, good game, congrats to the ABs, next time you're going down :-)
it sucks losing to the allblacks of all teams and they should get rid of robbie deans what is aussie thinking putting a former allblack as coach, robbie didn't win 5 super titles it was the crusaders full of allblacks that did! anyway the game was ok but losing like that is annoying i couldn't care less if we lost by 1 or 41 its still a loss and against no dan carter wow what a choke/joke ‌
Hey guys, sorry to hear about the defeat! I never watched the game, but got regular updates on cell phone. Can't BELIEVE Wallabies lost, and that after a 22-9 lead!!!! :(
Finally watched the whole game. It wasnt too bad. Same mistakes again and again which is really starting to shit me off. Deans' blind faith in his starting team is also wearing a bit thin. That said there has been some slight improvent over the last couple of games.
Bring Back Phil Waugh! He would have 100 test caps by now! Shame on you Robbie! Did the Waratahs not do that well in the Super 14 2010? Get over yourself! I'm glad the NZRU chose GH over you. You were responsible for ruining Christian Cullen, Andrew Merthens and Jonah Lomu All Blacks careers. Man up and don't let John 'Over-rated' Mitchell take all the flack!
Wallabies have improved over the last 2 games, I'm worried they may ruin our chances at the World record. Bring on Hong Kong!
tonight against the all blacks we witnessed one man (matt giteau) single handedly ruin the wallabies chances at winning.he lost 10 points at goal!!10 POINTS AT GOAL!!!australia would comfortably win if they had a GOOD kicker.
Sucks to see so many negative comments. The All Blacks sneaked through again like they did in the last test against the boks, they are the number one team in the world right now. The Wallabies played well mostly and only lost by a mere 1 point. They're improving with every game. Give them a break guys.
We need to work on out support and restrain from giving away stupid penalties! But besides that.... Fucking good game boys!!!!!!Especially Mr Beale and O'Connor! Xxxx :)
juss  like  the  commentators  said.  Robbie  deans  should  have  used  the  bench. Faingaa  shouldve   been  yanked    with  30  minutes  to  go.  Every  touch  of  his  turned  to  shit and  its  embarrassing   when  sharpey  is  trying  to  call   the  lineout  from  the  bench.
 so many mistakes, what were they thinking.........not worth waking up for all da shits in da field..........aaarrgghhh........faahhout!!
Yet again the wallabies fail to close the deal.  And what was with the lineout...it was shit.  What was Deans thinking not yanking Faingaa out....
Good job done boys!!!! Only thing is that we got a screwed up "Referee" !!!!!! The twins did so well, if only Q Cooper  or Phil Waugh were there, Wallabies could have nailed the "All Blacks" dead like a duck!!!! Why didn't the Coach not pick Phil Waugh for the Wallabies????? A BIG BIG Mistake!!!!
whats wrong with Genia's service......its too slow, he gives alot of time for the AB defense to organise before passing.....about time Deans starts yelling at his elite players........and maybe try and lure players from NRL.......imagine Greg Inglis playing at centre and kick Giteau out.......NRL have alot of potential props, its time to give Ma'afu the boot
WALLABY SCRUM. As an England fan I've been impressed by how Al Baxter improved his scrummaging over the last couple of years, but is this an example of what's wrong with the Oz scrum? It's taken him 6 or 7 years to develop into a reasonable scrummager when he has had the physical attributes to have been doing this for far longer. Is this because young Wallaby props are not exposed to quality opponents from a young age like happens in say England or France?
ahhhhhhhhhhfucking referee AGAIN! can somebody please just hire a DECENT REF WHOKNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING! jeez i could have done a better job!...... and as for the wallabies GOOD JOB BOYS! you made aus proud even though you didnt win you played with HEART and SOUL, big improvement! xxxxxxxx
dont know what the fuck happen to the wallabies they just like a junior wallabies hopeless fucking performance that i saw.....fuck you robbie deans you new zealander....
shame beale got picked again with him playing and no cooper it's gonna be tough in the backs.. how many times does beale he have to fuck up or drop the ball for people to realise he's not wallaby material. and someone needs to tell him to shave off his seedy mustache. good to see anthony in the team.. one of the best defenders in the game.
Send these Nthn hemisphere refs back to officiate their own shitty brand of rugby - i mean a red card for knocking the ball out of the hand of a player in touch seriously?! Mitchell was penalised twice only in the game and if either of those apparant penalaties were worthy of missing 30 odd minutes of the match well sry i thought i was watching rugby union not some pommy pillowfight - to the ref congrats mate u got urself in the headlines thanx for ruining what was gunna be a good match
As a wallaby supporter, I think the real problems the Wallabies suffered from today were; our "big guns" misfiring, playing too many young and inexperienced players against the all blacks, Richie McCaw thinking he was a Wallaby at the breakdown, and Drew Mitchell's first (and completely ridiculous in my opinion) yellow card, although his yellow one was completely called for. Plus, we have always raved about having electric backs and crap forwards, at least we actually tried to play some rugby albeit at the wrong times in the game. I feel this maybe again, due to the fact we have a poor decision maker at captain despite the fact he is a good rugby player.
Australia just won't learn....U can't let the Kiwis get a sniff otherwise they are a steamroller. U got to keep them under control. Play like the Poms do and don't let the ball move too wide keep it in the forwards as their backs r viciously quick..... anyway maybe next week...:-(
I don't understand why James O'Connor has a spot on the team - he seems to stuff up an awful lot.   Teenage sensation he may be, but he seems a bit young and inexperienced to be playing international rugby just yet.  But maybe I'm wrong...
This is bull shit O'neil should get with the real politics insted of puting the blame on the team and coach he should be ralling the sanza ceo's together and they should drag the irb and the north hemisphere powers that be we all here the panel talk about and sort this ref situation out. I dont know what they get paid but if want them to act profecinals then we need to pay them as pro's furthermore the panel has been talking about the way refs are assessed and they need to get certain penalties the game does not work that way just let the refs ref the game.

A 2 week ban for that tackle is a joke, 10 mins in the bin was enough. I understand that they have to be consistent, but that should not mean consistently wrong. Still if Pocock plays as well this week the Kiwis will be in all kinds of strife, he is a class act!

From ABC Grandstand on Twitter - Wallabies fly half Quade Cooper has failed in his appeal to have a 2 match ban overturned for a dangerous tackle.
We missed George Smith tonight. Losing to the poms is the worst sin in the world. They play shit rugby and smell like warm piss but we still lost. Disgusting
Giteau still shit please Robbie there is a guy on the bench half the price that can run pass and tackle and doesn't know how to loose barnes is his name
This is a fucking deadshit page.Nothing happens here and there is no intelligent rugby talk.Layty please come back 2 the ab page,We miss u very much.
WOW that's a shock, thanks George!!  you have been a great inspiration, a true  champion,  and consistently one of the best no.7s in the world. I am realy sad that I  wont be seeing you in the gold this year, We will miss your ability to lift a team or to come up with a game breaker, geez they are big boots to fill. Thanks for being something I could always count on when the Wallabies were playing shit.. and your humility. A great inspiration to all.  Thanks again George..
The backline is screwed. Gits is trying to be too trickey and is doing completly nothing, Quade is just shit all-round.. the guy has no talent, ryan cross didnt have a bad game but it was still awful and the wingers were the only ones that had a very good game and always made a break. See how wen O'conner replaced Quade  we make a break and score? And Ian, wat bloody backline are we 'unleashing'? If fiji just had disipline and fitness and also got good pay then they good beat most teams... they beat Wales in the World Cup? The kicking is killing us... the mid-field garry-owens are useless.  Someone needs to knock some fucking sense into the team.... there is no pride and aggression... my club team in under 14's could play with more heart then the wallabies.
Hi Wallabies fans, Brendan Cannon blogs live for The Daily Telegraph at 11am today about what went wrong against the Scots. Don't miss it.
Hey Ettiene Viviers, why dont ya f**k off back to your Bok page?? Are you planning to screw this page like you and ya poof mate Hans did the All Blacks one?? Ek sal kom en sny jou keel maar siek stap voet nog nooit in jou patetiese land, te veel geweld, moord, verkragtings en siektes vir my!
KooGa are ruining all our Super 14 team jerseys. I fear what they'll do to the Wallabies.
Very shocked to hear this news. Im from New Zealand and did not watch but what a shock to see the article on http://rugbyheaven.co.nz. I thought it nowhere near a possibility for the Scots to win. I hate to say it but Wales will most likely do the Wallabies over something shocking next week. I think Dean's time in Aus was up long ago. Get rid of him, he is not really wanted over here anymore. He might have to come and ply his trade in Shit Africa with you Ettiene.
I will have to post my comments on two posts Post 1You need to take a long hard look in the mirror boys as your supporters the people that actually pay your HUGE salaries are disappointed!!! You played like a load of amateurs, forget about all the excuses and bull shit stories about being a young team!!!!  Let’s think about this for one second………. Last week you were able to win the World champs, the Tri Nations champs and the Super 14 champs convincingly but tonight you were not able to win the All Blacks, a team that is supposes to be in dire straights?? A team that not even the All Black supporters thought would be able to win you tonight but yet again you disappointed not just your supporters but most importantly yourselves!!!!!!
What a great effort from the Wallabies, with all the disruptions to their preparation (injuries etc) they played with much more passion than the AB's and more daring as well.They now need to get more savvy at the  breakdown, it was clear all night that the AB's were sealing the ball off on the Wallabies ball, this can't be tolerated, it slowed the ball down too much to get any real momentum, @Emily, you can;t counter ruck that the only thing that will fix that is running up the stairs of those players who are willing to lie on the wrong side of the ruck to slow the ball down. Well done wallabies but be smarter and the winds will come.Great game from Genia as well.
Barnes is so fragile, he's worse than Rathbone and McMeniman early in their careers. Don't want him to become another Daniel Heenan.Go Wallabies! Looking forward to Digby Ioane carving up the field (if he gets the ball :(
It's just a shame to watch the Wallabies lose so many games this year... :(They have so much potential to make a huge success, but I'm really disappointed so far in 2009. The end of year tour coming up is the perfect chance to regain their pride
Anyone from WA? If you are, you will sure to have noticed that channel seven are broadcasting the game tonight at 12:00am! And are running a rerun of fkn broken arrow at 10pm! Anyone care to start a boycott off channel seven? This shit is just not cool, WA has a growing Rugby players and supporters fan base and channel seven has once again pissed us off, enough is enough! Please boycott all channel seven shows and products ect ect and hit them where it hurts. (thier profit margin) By the way, go the Wallabies!
I'\m so angry after that game! We had it and then we lost it. We do it so often. These guys get paid millions and yet tehre is no winning fire there, what's wrong? Where is an Eales or a Gregan. Have this team no pride in a win?  I'm so disgusted I could spit!!
Best coach in the world and players that only play for one half. Lets have a back row at 6'5 like in 1998 2002 and players with the knowledge that can string past 4 phases. Lets look to the future this is a shit all black side spoken to me by an kiwi so why are the players loosing it, who will stand up and be counted. Kefu scores try in eales last game, Eales kicks goal after full time in 2001 to win game where are these guys who have played 50 tests standing up, time for change
Handling errors let the Wallabies down again and gaps in the back defence.  Can't help but to wonder what happened to the Wallabies' glory days as a superfighting rugby team.  No wonder the boks are no. 1 these days.  Even all blacks are on top.  The new additions to the Wallaby national team have not meld together or gain enough test match experience and the teams they are up against have far more experience even though they were rather average performers in the past and were shut down by a rock solid wallaby defence.  Can't help but to think tt the new players are not as good as the old ones. A little judgmental here but hope time will prove this view wrong. The little cheer was towards the tail end of the game when Matt Giteau and Lachie Turner conjured a bit of magic and got the ball past the line but too late. They showed what the team was capable of and what they could potentially do. If only this level of performance was sustainable and consistent throughout the game.
the ARU need to get there fucking hesd out of the sand and put a decent side on the field. Warringah rats under 9`s play better than this current wallabies squad
What is happening guys?!?! Is it the players? coaching staff? nerves? :( good start to the second half though! got  a bit anxious when habana scored again and switched channels lol..Good game o'connor.. but in saying that.. what is happening??
Look, let’s call a spade a spade!!! I was at the game tonight and I will keep on supporting my beloved Wallabies but boys your game was pretty ordinary tonight and I am pissed off!!!!!!!! I am actually so disappointed that I am at a loss for words!!! We fail to finish games when in the lead and when we are behind we try to win the bloody game 5 min from the end of the game!!! This is not how the game of rugby is played. Basically it boils down to this……You need to up your game at this stage you just do not make the grade as easy as that!!!
I just want to apologise for any hurtful comments I may have made on this page prior to today. However, I would also like to remind a few of you that I have also made a bulk of comment on the progress which I still believe WILL occur before 2011 with the young talent coming through this team. Robbie has always been a master of building up young teams and he will do it again. May I also remind you that I have found out the wrong way many times that a team that succeeds between world cups will not win one, but a team that develops towards one will (Just like yourselves at present). Our All Blacks had arguably their most successful four year period prior to the last world cup, and what did we get to show for it??? Not even our usual Bronze medal!!! Infact it was our worst world cup ever. Good luck to the Wallabies on turning this around... Youre getting closer and closer and a Bledisloe Cup series will be yours soon!!! Apologies once again, Goodnight!
I so wanted to fly down to Cape Town this weekend, but unfortunately everything is soooo expensive!:( but, i'll still be watching the game, 'up north', wearing my Wallabies jersey and cap! hehe... And get 'slaughtered' in the process...;)
Tighthead Tezza says Bugger! I guess we failed to follow Greg Growden's seven point plan:1. 'Stop being head cases and instead use your heads' - yes we lost our heads...again and again and again (3 sin bins, etc)!2. 'Take responsibility' - Again a good start but where was the fire and foot on the throat???3. 'Don't be intimidated' - Let's not talk lineouts!4. 'Antagonise Bakkies Botha' - Let's still not talk about lineouts.5. 'Learn from the All Blacks' - One try does not win a game, we took our foot off the peddle, again! Though a good second try 6. 'Play the corners' - OK so were was the kicking game???7. 'Composure, composure, composure' - Poor Lachie Turner an unkind bounce can really stuff composure. Still you would think two tries to one would help, obviously not if you allow superboot near goal posts and continue to give him opportunities to shoot at them.Bugger again! Still we aren't really that far away from them or the ABs, so bring on the home tests.
Springboks beath All Blacks... M. Steyn 31 points (Tri Nations record)... 1 converted try, and 8 penalty goals?!? What a joke. Someone tell the IRB to bring back the ELV's...Robbie Deans - our prayers are with you and your family :(
To all Rugby fansI rang the ARU to complain about 7's pathetic shit coverage. The ARU sold the coverage rights to 7 so have no control over 7's coverage. The ARU shares our displeasure over 7's coverage so I urge all Rugby fans to direct your complaints to 7 as the ARU said the more of us who complain to 7 the more likely they will listen.Don't just talk get active we have a great code but please don't pay out on other games as there is room for all of us.Give 7 the walloping they deserve don't hold back!!!!
congratulations to the man of the match in the Australia vs Wales test -the referee. One set of rules for Wales, another for Australia.The most inept and disgraceful refereeing I have ever seen. It's a shame it ruined the game.

Describing my experience at Cargo Bar this past weekend as 'professionally embarrassing' (on your part) would be a gross understatement. Soon after paying the fee and entering the club, we were confused when a member of our party was asked to follow an un-uniformed, un-named Cargo Bar 'employee' who failed to mention his authority throughout the process of dealing with our friend. When our friend was asked to leave the club with no explanation and at such an early point of the night, we assumed there had been a misunderstanding seeing as (in the least biased way) he was doing nothing but interacting sensibly in a normal social dynamic - which I would have thought to have been regular behaviour in a club environment. Due to the introverted nature of our friend, he simply respected the un-justified order and proceeded outside where he continued a conversation with the rest of us, discussing alternate arrangements to accommodate the situation at hand. An aggressive security guard who seemed to have a bloated sense of importance began forcefully and irrationally escorting us all away. Considering we were causing no harm or nuisance we believed it was within our rights to calmly question why we were being ushered away. Despite the fact that absolutely no scene was being created, the guard proceeded to push us (two girls) in the direction he wanted- with no explanation at that. It is evident that whatever second rate company from which your security staff are recruited, has clearly failed to brief them on what they are legally prohibited from doing. Any type of physical contact from a staff member to a patron who is not a danger to others or themselves is harassment and is punishable in a court of law. It is extremely out of the ordinary for me to post a complaint like this, but I especially feel displeased with the treatment my friends and I received from a club in which we have had many good nights. It would have been advisable to notify patrons upon entry that at any given time they may be forcibly removed from the club in order to make room for other patrons arriving later in the evening, to increase the clubs profits by way of extra entry fares- which seems to be the reasoning for such unfair treatment. Additionally, a warning may as well be issued as to the high possibility of being illegally man-handled by brash security guards who don’t seem to have any idea what the phrase ‘professional negligence’ entails. The professionalism demonstrated on Saturday night was appalling to say the least, and reflects very poorly on our impressions of Cargo Bar.  
I feel so incredibly blessed to be able to experience the purity and natural beauty of australia's beaches and it's rejuvenating power. Don't be a shit human and litter this planet. It doesn't belong to us, we belong to it and its f*cking amazing.

Like gump once said, me & jenny we go together like peas and carrots...and so  too does #therook burger with chips... A sneaky little roof top bar/ restaurant on york st... Perfect presentation, #burgernchips  nestled nicely on a plate rather then the dreaded breadboard... Nice to have some chips this week after the much publicised #rockpoolbarandgrill chip FAIL last #burgerfriday... The rook burger delivered in many ways... Super stackability, juicy slab of wagyu, perky pickle, cheddar cheese and tastey relish... However, agreeing w/ my burger buddy, the burger was a bit 'bunny' and it rang true... Like the caramelised shell of a creme brulee, the bun is the entrance point of the burger,  it's that pivotal first impression. But all too often it becomes the 12th man... It's there as a filler only... But all said, great service and at $20 with chips ... Hard to beat for a cbd burger... It gets a 'ran strong' 7 patty rating out of 10...#sydney #australia #burgers #burgerreview #burgerrating #relish
This is the Ozzies "How to week.....". Every year it's the same, in all the newspapers, "This is how to beat the ABs". Every year the experts get it wrong. I'm looking forward to the Bledisloe this year because when the ABs win you can't blame a NZ coach for your loses. Though it will be interesting to see and hear what excuses you come up with.
