Hi Roamz! Just wondering when the winners of the signed cd's will be announced. Thank you :)
A fantastic evening in the Creepy Lab! A great bunch of enthusiastic folks, sparks of inspiration and lots of my favourite type of question: the kind where the answer is, "I don't know. Let's try it and see!" More excited than ever about the "grow and sew" project :)
Finally moved into our own apartment yesterday. This is the view from the balcony :)
No place for holindaise!!! Amazing black pudding dish, try the chorizo stew next time.

Business move (and slightly coz im addicted to your gelato)...Have a weekly draw on Facebook where you randomly select a fan or fans of Messina an ice-cream on the house? ;-)
If only there was an app or a site dedicated to listing the flavours that each store stocks daily...would save a lot of running around! :D
Elivs The Fat Years ... Nuff Said :D 
Dear Messina, someone really important to me has been begging you to bring back the lemon meringue pie. Please, please do so. It's nearly Christmas, consider this a simple wish from the 2 (or  thousands) of us... Thanks. :)
you know what would be a great surprise? waking up and hearing that pavlova is hitting the shop today....... yes??!! :) 
Would this amazing pictures warrant some sort of a freebie?
Mr Messina, can I puleaze put in a request for a macaroon inspired gelato :-)
Are you guys looking for staff for the new Surry Hills store? If so, what experience will the eager candidates need ? :-)
I "like" lots of Facebook pages but I think this has to be in my top 3! I LOVE all your Gelato pictures and that last status update cracked me up! It's nice to have something come in to your newsfeed that actually makes you smile! :) Phoodie
Mmmm Messina! I ate you the other day... and I put you on my blog :) xxhttp://mojomade.blogspot.com

Ever thought of making some german spaghettieis? :3
Dear Gelato Messina, next weekend I will be taking part in The Stampede and as a reward (if I survive) would love it if Messina brought back Golden Rough and Cremino... would be happy with variations.  Thank you kindly, Dom :) 
Please say a very big hello to Donato and Danny from me! Only been in London for a year and a half and two new shops have opened, a huge congrats! I get very jealous I‚Äôm not back in Syd when I see all your specials updates‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt managed to find a gelato in Europe that tastes anywhere near as good. Hope you guys are doing well :D 
I am so excited that you made Lemon Meringue Pie :) I'll see you tonight!!!
i brought the apple pie gelato a little while back and I told the girl i was going to try and take it back to canberra with me.. she told me to post it here whether i could do it or not.. i have exams this week and currently studying with my tub of messina in canberraa! :) WINNERRR! :)
Just wanted to pass on a message from Christian Lo Russo from Amy Meredith: "Bring back the Elvis the Fat Years flavour!" :)
Came for the first time today, definitely coming back! Rivals the gelato I had all over Italy. Happy we took 3 flavours home :) well done guys!

One of the nicest health clubs in the city.  Amazing saline pool.  Any group class taught by Cecily Guest will be a tough but ultimately satisfying workout.

Dear Sally and team, I was watching an episode of Four Weddings Australia on the weekend and I was so happy to see all the rival brides comment on how beautiful the food was at Dockside Cockle Bay - I was  even happier when this bride won the honeymoon prize! Can't wait for our wedding :)
Best meal I had in Sydney. Chef Kylie Kwong was in the kitchen. 14 tables. No rezzies. The duck was AMAZING, crab close 2nd. Definitely try the house wine & snag a cookbook.
The shopping is amazing in Spring....Little Italy is soo small though!
Ask for personal trainer Jose'. Will be glad to help and get you started with your ignition or show you around the health club. =)
Standing up so ppl can get out and offering your seat to those who might need it more than you. It's the least :)
Ask the management to require all box office personnel to wear a nametag for better customer service ;). A service with a smile goes a long way.
Check out one of treasury's great restaurants, one of my many favourites is the lab :)

Get your morning coffee here! They have amazing coffee blend. Just find out that they apparently use Adore Estate Coffee blend (http://www.adorecoffee.com.au/). No wonder they have really good coffee
Favourite cafe in the city. The people there are probably the nicest and most friendliest people you'll meet. Food is amazing. Always very busy, but there is definitely a reason for that!
Try the new coffee jelly!! :D
Pengen ke Starbucks... Next week :)
One of the best Italian meals I've ever had. Gnocchi bolognese and the pizzas are amazing
Kinokuniya is great, but King's prices of most Trades, and their selection of new comics is hard to beat. Check both, it will at least be fun :)

Episode 2 of Vans BOWL-A-RAMA Bondi 2012 ‚Äì Roll In presented by Surf Dive N Ski!We caught the Tic Taco exhibition at Beach Burrito.

It featured photographs of skating superstars Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero and Shaun White, as well as the always amazing talent at BOWL-A-RAMA!(Also big thanks to Huawei Mobile for helping us capture the action on the new Vision mobile).

Hi all, I need everyone's help. I was there in October and purchased the most amazing smelling candle and it's now nearly run out and I can't find her business card to reorder, I know there were lots of candle places there, if it helps the owner was blonde and looked late 20's she also made melts, and it's a yellow candle which I believe to be pomegranate flavour, could anyone help with the name of this ladies business?

Hi Twenty & Six,We reviewed a great massage therapist in Nth Melb, Milk & Honey Remedial Massage. As with all of our features we asked for they're best coffee and food recommendation and it was for you guys :) AND they're giving away two massages - visit us at Nourish Melbourne to find out how to win one! /NM (P.S. We think you're awesome too, nevermind what anyone else says!)
Thanks for letting me work at your table so long today lovelies. I credit the mini-PhD breakthrough moment I had to the combined effects of the delish Geisha and you guys keeping me well caffeinated on the cold day :) thanks! X

Amazing story shared by John Coyle yesterday at the AGM. Never ceases to amaze me the courage of people who have such tough hands dealt to them in life. Felt proud as a founding and life member!!! Keep up the good work ACD.

Daniel Kitson's amazing show, 66A Church Road, is poignant, poetic and charmingly funny. Go watch it before December 13
Songs for Nobodies. Amazing talent!
Great food and view but disappointed about the service - just poor communication skills (confusion re simple request). Watch the seagulls too! Aggressive and cheeky little buggers!! :)
Great place to enjoy a cold beer while soaking up some sun, fantastic views of Sydney CBD and the Harbour Bridge as well.
Awesome views. Make sure you get a gelato and sit on the grass. One if the best spots to see the beauty,hustle, bustle and life of the emerald city. Enjoy. PS the chocolate gelato is great ;)
Take advantage of the free Wi-Fi trial from Cityrail! :-)
Light your cigarette and smile to CCTV camera :)
Choose this over buses when heading to Town Hall or Central. Five minutes on CityRail beats CBD congestion any day.
Queen st mall in cbd is nice shopping
The food is amazing, unfortunately the speciality drinks are usually lava hot and tasteless. I wish they would get a new barista.
Lovely Sydney  :) fell in love

Get a I <3 PCC badge or t-shirt.

Free wi-fi :)
This place looks great! And the name so fitting :) will you e open for dinner as well? Or just lunches.
Amazing dinner last night, thanks so much. The food and service is absolutely amazing. My only critisim would be that the music was a tad too loud for a Sunday night making it difficult to hold a conversation with my guests over a large table. Would have been nice if the music was more in the background than booming overhead... maybe I'm just getting older :) ... Once again thanks for an incredible dinner. Look forward to returning soon.
Finally something like this comes to the Billi.. not going to lie, got high hopes for you! :)
What a find! Arrive hungry for amazing food & service! Pisco Punch, pulled pork, peanut butter & banana sundae. Delicious!

Keep your eye out for the amazing Lime Cheesecake flavoured gelato. Spotting it is rarer than a whale-sighting, but unlike whale, people won't think you're a monster for eating it.

Later this month, I'll be moving offices to our new mega-complex at Darling Park. No permanent desk (let alone an office!) means that many things I've kept with me at work HAVE to go.....like a massive 4ft tall Domokun plush toy!So, earlier today, #OperationDomokunCBDUplift commenced. With thanks to Michael Air and Josie Kidd , Domo has an awesome new home (or crisis accommodation, if you prefer) with the tech/social media startup, Roamz.http://www.flickr.com/photos/ozdj/sets/72157627842387292/ (With thanks to Michael and Josie for the "Domo at Roamz" pix)

YOU ARE MY FAVORITE PLACE RIGHT NOW, MY OFFICE HAS BECOME OBSESSED SINCE I FOUND YOU <3
So I have been to you guys twice now. Both times I have gotten a takeaway Diavolo burger. I discovered this burger when I came in the first time and asked for a recommendation.You guys have delivered fantastic food both times, some damn friendly service and I can safely say I'm satisfied like I have never been from a food shop in a long time.Consider this my new burger joint.Will be back again soon. <3
Fried fish salad is my favourite dish in here, yum yum:)

Attn: Donato :)2 possible gelato creations comin' at ya... Chai and Rice Pudding.Thoughts?
I think you guys would make an amazing Green Tea gelato, just hinting ;)
Bring back the Black Forest, it's amazing!
Dear Messina, my best friend (who is very special and important to me) and her house mate ( who is important to me and her) and someone who is special to him have been begging you to bring back the lemon meringue pie. Please do so because I don't want to listen to her complaining about them complaining. Much appreciated :) love Babs!
I went to Noto in Sicily and had the most amazing mandarine gelato - I would love to be able to buy it from you guys as you are much closer than Sicily :-)
Will you ever bring back the Mr Potato Head flavour?? I severely regret not buying a lifetime supply. I expected it to be good, but not quite that amazing!!
When are the new flavours coming?:)
Hey Messina,I was in Rome earlier this year and there's gelato bar near Giolliti's that had the most amazing profiterole flavour, it was classic creamy bacio with tiny choux pastries filled with whipped cream. How about it? Think you can do that? :P
BANOFFEE PIE FLAVOUR !! Pastry, Banana, Caramel & Cream.. Bring it!! :)  
specials board update please :) im coming in tonight!!
This ice cream is the bomb!! Can you open a store on Perth :)
You need to open a store in Victoria! :)
I just want to say a HUGE thank you for making the most amazing sorbets ever! As a person with multiple food intolerances who doesn't get the pleasure of enjoying gelato (unless I am naughty and want to pay the price), it is great to find a place that has put effort into creating sorbets apart from the usual lemon and orange and passionfruit. I indulged in strawberry and chocolate last weekend and I am in love!!!! I come from the Hills to your shop but it is worth it! I am guessing many people drive further than I do. I was shocked to see a choice of 10 flavours!!! Is this normal? Do you always have so many sorbets or was I just lucky? If you ever make banana or blueberry please let me know! There are not many fruits I can eat.As for caramel gelato.....omg that sound divine! I am so jealous!!!
After having ice-cream for lunch yesterday XD, I realised that you guys should get messina loyalty cards like in gloria jeans and stamp them every time we get ice-cream. 6 and we get one free :)
I am still hoping for an apple and salted plum sorbet... :)
I think you guys need to bring out a lolly banana flavour :)
I sat at this place for about 2 hours near the end of July, savouring my way through into a gelato coma.  A highlight of the year.  Absolutely loved the:- Arabian Knights gelato cake;- Pandan & Coconut gelato - first spoon seemed overwhelming, but tasted better and better to the point of amazing with each spoonful. - Panna Cotta , Fig Jam and amaretti gelato.- Aprikosh gelato.- Packed Fig in Masala gelato! Equal top favourite.Also whoever was whipping the gelato was charming and easy on the eyes.  He let a little kid and I try the Bounty Chocolate (I think) gelato he was freshly whipping, and it just melted like marshmellows...A bit of a recreational baker myself and wanted to share my idea.  Just made a cheesecake of Elderflower mascarpone cream cheese with Lime (zest and infused raisins) and Lychees, with a Rose Chiffon sponge (on a Ginger nut biscuit base).  Absolute Heaven.  Elderflower - Lychee - Rose - Lime : I'd love to see that in Gelato form.
I can see that we will be expecting to see some Gelato Messina on The Living Room tonight :)
Please bring back Dr Evil and / or black forest! Please both are amazing!!
Fell in love with your Chocolate & Absinthe gelato last night. I'll be back for more today :D
oh my goodness - reopening TOMORROW!  Woohoo!!  We need some before and after photos :)
I was hoping you guys might do a Bacon and Maple Syrup gelato at some point. Please make it happen! <3
Hi There, do you have the same flavours in all three stores? were wanting to go to the one at the star :)
<3 apple pie <3
I usually hate cherry ripe but 1985 was amazing! (so was the sangwitch) :)
Hello, I would adore it if you could please be so kind as to make Mr Potatohead flavour again as I've missed it up until now and am simply dying to try it! Even the sales team at The Star were saying how much they loved it when I asked them whether they would have it in again today. Please please please! In fact, any way you can use peanut butter is GOOD! Thanks :)
I have some flavour ideas and would totally allow you to use my name or some sort of pun without even paying royalties!- milo and coffee (the Davis cuppa) :)- Banana and nutella- fairy bread- Staceys smores and finally 'Sophia Grace Brownie' some brownie and strawberry concoction names after this cutie who loves pink (I gave you the name, you can come up with the flavour)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7hTAp6KrGY
i notice you seem to be doing the cherry thing a bit lately. I think a black forest type special would be amazing. vanilla or white choc gelato, sour cherries, booze, chocolate sponge, maybe some chocolate custard? Please!! Oh and if you could try and feature the amazing looking cherry ones midweek for us that work near Messina but don't live near it would be appreciated by at least 1 customer, me!
I would like to suggest a rice pudding flavour. I had "riso" in Florence and it was awesome! <3
OK... so... Are you sitting down?With this heat I've been tossing up between a gelato or a G&T... and then it occurred to me...I'm thinking a Gin and Tonic sorbet would go down a treat!Tell me you love it! It's amazing, right?
Gelato Messina „Äú Australia's Best Love your gelato and cake, simply the best <3 http://foodblogs84.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/gelato-messina-australias-best.html
A gelato store in Newtown I am fond of does a Fig & Cinnamon sorbet, as well as a Banana Split (banana sorbet, walnuts and vegan chocolate sauce). I implore you to make some more creative sorbets for us non dairy eaters!!A chocolate overload (eg. sorbet, hazelnuts and vegan fudge brownie) perhaps?Or apple and cinnamon? Cheesecake (my trick is a little bit of lime sorbet with the coconut and pandan ;-))PS: I LOVE coconut & pandan. Omnomnom! 
Just had a scoop of your "Gooey" peanut butter gelato. Caused a minor obstruction on the sidewalk as I was literally stopped in my tracks by the first taste. Amazing! :D
you guys are the only ones in Australia that have yoghurt flavour..before that I had to go all the way to Italy for a gelato! darlinghurst is much closer..THANKYOU :)
bring back Ode to Zeno's!! :) :)
Christian said to bring back the Elvis the fat years flavour :) <3

I return to Sydney on the 13th of October after 6 weeks in Nepal/India. the first thing I  want to do when I arrive is head to Messinas. Will you have the black forest gelato at surry hills store? :)
If you spot Danny in the gelato Messina stores today make sure you wish him a happy 40th birthday. He LOVES the attention that only a milestone birthday can bring - I promise ;) 
Any chance of an ANZAC cookie flavour? :)
Fingers crossed your Darlinghurst store still has soursop and cremino in stock for tonight?! Been looking fwd to this :-)))

Hi guys! Im singing at Pitt St Mall in Westfield Sydney today from 12pm! The first 200 ppl to arrive get to come up on stage and get stuff signed ! ;) xWestfield Tour: www.facebook.com/events/487486737934515/
I stayed in pitt street for almost 2 hours today listening to the amazing buskers that sydney has on offer. The crowds filled the entire area and it was amazing to see the effect, of the music, on the people there. This music not only draws customers to the shops along the promenade but increases the appeal and culture of the area for locals and tourists alike. Its nice to stop, have a listen, drop in some spare change and go back to shopping or work. I'm sure it makes a difference in the buskers lives, but more so it increases the appeal of Westfield in allowing them to perform.So lets help keep these guys performing in an area known for love, music and free hugs!Don't take away one of the few channels new musicians have to be heard.
Dear Westfield,I do my best to avoid you. Why??1. You take business away from the city centre with free car parks, then after you have killed a CBD you start charging.2. Trying to wipe out busking, the same people that walk into your shops and spend money, the same musicians that wish to have their CD's stocked in your store.Your a prime example of a company that is too big to care about what people think of it. You are the equivalent of a small business with rude staff- it will lose market share, and as you use your power to put people out, you will too.Congrats.

YOU LUCKY SYDNEY-SIDERS! Ladur√©e opening up for you.  Yes, I am massively green with envy.  I've only ever been able to salivate from here in Brisbane.  Gosh darn, I hope they open up here.  I know this city is not as classy as Melbourne and Sydney, that's why we need them.  Hopefully we'll be able to shop online from them.  I want to try their Marie Antoinette tea.  Crossing my fingers, toes, eyes...and anything else that can be contorted lol

Shame on you Westfield!! What's wrong with this image posted all over your store?? Mmmm, it's screaming anorexia & photoshop!!  Thats not a real model & if she is, she needs some food on her plate!!! Not a good example or role model.  If there is anywhere to complain, Ill be complaining!! :)

I feel like a child who's been awakened from his sleep and taken downstairs in someone's arms to see the party and the guests. Who knows how long it will last, who knows when that considerate adult will send you back to bed and life will once more be that poignant band of life beneath the door, beyond which all the voices, laughter, and happiness lie?- Andrew Holleran (Dancer from the Dance, 1978)

Alway look at the view, its amazing you need to look
If you're craving for some chocolate ice cream but without the dairy then try the Vegan Mocha Chip @the gelato section next to the Coffee Bar on the main floor.. yummm! :)
It's not cheap, and the place doesn't have a lot of character, but maybe that's so you can concentrate on the amazing flavours of the degustation menu.
Highly recommend 200g Wagyu oyster fillet! Onion rings too ;)
Go to ben's cookies,the best cookies of london,amazing!
Best place in london Ôíì 3ajeeeeeeeeeeeeeba <3

Have my favorite "caramel Hokkaido" or Okinawa brown sugar milk tea:) yum , love it sweet but you probably want it less sweet;)
Milk tea with jelly balls or red beans, amazing stuff, takes me right back to China :)
If you like joggers then this is the place to be. If you don't like them its also the place to be because a well timed bump could knock a few over the cliff :-)
My asvise: Watch out for the unrelenting sk8er bois near the war memorial. Have a nice time :)

Then on Saturday, Rogers Room are playing main set at theclub. Looking forward to seeing Tom Crookes and Benn Markos aka Kid Crookes, then wishing Darko Vidovic a happy bday! boom
When i caught a couple from Penrith rooting in the bathroom, he tried to deny it, then she says in her westie voice, " dont lie, you just filled me up !! " .... Amazing.

The most amazing pork buns, dare I say better than Momofuku.
Definitely one of the best pork buns I have eaten around Sydney. The gyozas on the other hand are another story. Had to use the microscope to find it. ;) the Ramen no. 6 was very nice.
Movie nights in union square! Showing the artist on July 14 -- happy Bastille day :)
The duck is amazing, fish cakes were great too, plus the gingerbread biscuits and ice cream!

Lunch kitchen closes at 3:30. Dinner menu changes every week, dinner serves on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
In the CBD tonight, looking for a bit o fun, a $10 meal special and truly the best craft beer in town?... Harts Pub from 7pm
Since it's Thirsty Thursday we thought we would share the best beer ad ever made. One Small Planet we know that Harts Pub are so cool, they don't need a beer ad! :) 
OMG!!! You must put the choc chip cookie skillet front and centre in your next marketing campaign to attract the wives and girlfriends. Amazing!!!
Man, what a pub! Our favourite so far in our recently-started Sydney Pub List blog. Great food and fantastic beers, at a great price considering the location. We've been in a few times now and we'll keep coming back. Great stuff! Our full review here :)
Have really enjoyed the Night Nurse by Young Henrys at Harts Pub the last few days. We hope you continue to pour more great brews by this Newtown brewer at your fine establishment :)
Thanks for an amazing night!!!!
 Strictly Ballroom star ,Cooking With Beer author,Mercurio's Menu TV show host and craft beer brand creator Paul Mercurio  has been trying to organise midweek drinks in Sydney for a couple of weeks when he comes up from Melbourne before he goes on the Sunrise program on Wedneday mornings for the Cooking segment ....lets make sure he doesn't drink alone any more ;)......."24 hours notice to my friends - I am having a drink at Harts Pub in the Rocks (Sydney) from 6.30 till around 9 tomorrow (Tuesday) If no one shows up by 9 I will have one more just in case you are running late.CheersSad Sack"
Should use this for the 4 Pines ESB description. =)
A happy visit in this pub. Thanks James for your informative session about beers! :)
Just wondering why your Magic Cave is nothing like the one in Adelaide??? I remember going to the Adelaide one as a kid and it was awesome! Now my friends are posting photos of their kids there and it still looks amazing. We took our daughter to see Santa for the first time at your's last year, dragged the grandparents along and all and it was was Santa and a room of pretty much nothing! Adelaide has a merry-go-round and so much more...why can't Melbourne have the same? We now have a second baby who will be having her first Santa visit this year and I wont be making the effort to drive into the city and pay for parking to come to the Melbourne "Magic Cave". I'll just go to one of the local shopping centres because it's pretty much the same. Going to the Magic Cave is meant to be an experience...you take your time going through it to see everything. It's how so many people I know remember going to see Santa as a kid. Please, please, please make it more like the one in Adelaide! 
The brownie with fairy floss and vanilla bean ice-cream is to die for. Soft but chewy - amazing.
The double choc brownie is amazing!

{LUNCH DATE} Me & Mr Man have been having lunch out a lot recently ‚Äì which is just LOVELY in my book. If you‚Äôre up to speed with everything new in the caf√© world you‚Äôll know that North Melbourne has recently had mini serge of very slick, cool & happening eateries. We checked out Twenty & Six Espresso for lunch during the week & it did not disappoint. This beautiful decked out caf√© complete with courtyard is the perfect spot for a great smooth tasting coffee along with a light lunch, having said that my lunch was anything but light. I went for (wait for the name!) The Hulk ‚Äì avocado with fresh salmon on sour dough.  It was AMAZING!!  (Check out the snap below.) HIGHLY recommend this place for a lunch date for two. Leave the bubba's at home ‚Äì this place is VERY cosy & is more suited for take-away coffee for the pram wheeling mammas. But they also have one child friendly breakfast options for the older kids! Yum!! http://www.twentyandsix.com.au/

AMAZING coastal walk from Coogee Beach to Bondi Beach.
Nice day for it :)
In the sprit of Thanksgiving (sure why not, we're a nation of well-intended philanthropic plagiarists lol), I share with all my family and friends this beautiful quote: 'Every time you and I interact...a bit of "heart" is born between us. Heart isn't something inside you. But whenever you think, whenever you remember someone, that's when heart is born. I mean, if you were the only one alive in the whole world, heart wouldn't exist, now would it?'

heard a LOT about SO coffee .. thought it was just Sydney hyping everything up as usual .. but nope. Your reputation is really really well deserved. Best coffee around .. and love the quirkiness of the cafe :-)I'll brave the Surry Hills hills for it .. 
single n free :)
<3 you have the best website  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ
Hey just clicked on the link to your website on the left there... you missed the ".au" :)
I got an idea for SOR... prepaid bean bag cards, kind of like the subscriptions but more choice  when to receive a new bag of beans ;) 
Sadly, tomorrow Friday the 20th of January will be my last day working at Single O down on Reservoir St. I have some amazing memories to take away with me and won't soon be forgetting all of the wonderful people I have met. I have made coffee for Ren√© Redzepi, worked at Marque Restaurant, served Weird Al and had Tobey Maguire cover me on the coffee machine while I took a break, amongst so many other wonderful and bizarre experiences that only a place like Single O can offer.A big thank you in particular to Dion, Shoji and Matt for both inspiring me to learn and work hard. It's been a fun ride and I won't forget it. Thank you to all the customers who have made an lasting impression. I'm sure you all know who you are and I hope we can stay in touch.As for what I'm doing next? Who knows... I'm going to pursue my lifelong ambition of not just being a barista forever and all I can say is to watch this space. Until next time, I'll leave you with some Country and Western, I hope that that's what I'm remembered for and that's what will be missed in the caf√© most of all.Joe out.
Hey guys coming to visit in the next few days from Cartel Coffee Roasters ill bring you some beans :) cant wait

Catalogue of my night Westfield:Movie time? 4:30pm on Sunday Movie cost? $27 - which is RIDICULOUSMovie? Overtly long and a poor choice (my fault)Validated parking ticket? YesParking free? No.  $10I came out of the movie and grabbed a Max Brenner's shake, thinking with a validated ticket I was fine.  Not the case.So, on a Sunday evening a trip for one person to watch a movie costs $37????  Actually, it would have only been $34, if I didn't stop and get the shake.What a joke! #won't be back.

Will you guys be open this Friday? :)
just wondering, can you make any of your cakes gluten free? would love one for my birthday :)
Christian said to bring back the Elvis the Fat Years flavour. You know you want to ;)
BRING BACK LEMON MERINGUE PIIIIIIIE!Pavlova also needs to be bumped up to "staple" status :)
Actually had my first bad Gelato Messina today.. Had the Choc Chip, the chocolate chips were WAY too big, like a third of the ice cream scoop, and The Chocolate Yuzu, this flavour was actually bad.. Salted Caramel was obviously amazing..
Just 3 worlds: I MISS YOU!!! :)
hey guys, called your phone number 8354 1223 five times in the last half hour no response, just rings out? any ideas? 
Cannot believe I still haven't seen the "hot" new Messina at the casino .... No doubt you will rock it boys well done yet again :)
Christian from Amy meredith said bring back Elvis the Fat years is peanut butter banana chocolate flavour <3 Pretty please XX.
Great Name :)
Hey guys, are all of your products suitable for vegetarians? Is there any gelatine in any of your products? <3
Hi, I was in the Surry Hills store today & one of Declan's mixes was playing, I was wondering if there was any chance of getting a copy, it was awesome!  Thanks :)
Hi! I am a huge fan of amazing gelato! but living out west in blacktown makes it very hard to get to! When will you guys be opening out west? Parramatta would be perfect for you! or even strathfield for that matter? Also, what day do your flavours changeover.
Can you purchase your gelato by the cone or cupful anywhere else besides the amazing Star location? X
I think we're overdue for another return of banoffee :). #justsayin
Addicts... we confess... Everyday Eats' Favourite Sweet Treat for the 2nd year running: Gelato Messina. More <3 in the new EE guide out today!
Three days in a row we ended up at Messina ... sweetest Easter ever :-)
When will you be bringing back your red velvet flavour? I would like to buy a whole tub:)
Any chance you could tell us what music is played in your Crown St store - it's fantastic. Love the gelato too btw ;)
Have you done a 'snickers' type flavour? I'm thinking peanut butter, lots of nuts, caramel :)
Can you please do banana again- we don't care if it looks brown, it tastes soooo good:)
I think you guys should update your daily specials online :)
Burnt butter and sage is to die for ... Thank you! Enjoying it with Heathers :-) 
Massive thank you for my 1L take home pack! Was so overcome by excitement when John was scooping it out for me today, don't even know if I said thank you! Black Forrest is out of this world, I love it so much I want it's babies! And absinthe was awesome. Nice one Messina, you know I love u, but I'll say it again-  I love you :) 
hi, i have a special suggestion: chocolate sorbet with meringue pieces and raspberry puree :Dlove sophia 
which of your flavours are vegan friendly?you folk are amazing, thanks for years of gastrorgasms ;)
LOVE pavlova at like half a kilo of the stuff last time i went there lol xxx
I'm sicilian and I missed this gelato so much... but I'm coming back! :) your gelato is awesome!

Messina....Will you be my Valentine ? <3

Christian said to bring back the Elvis the fat years flavour <3
Do you guys still have the musk gelato? Wanna come grab some tonight :)
Can you please let me know when the McQueen has returned ( licorice and dark choc. 1 will come and buy  1500ml .... And my trainer doesn't have to know anything about this purchase lol. 
LOL. just reading the comments makes my mouth water. my vote: salted caramel and white choc.
OMG! Everything looks so beautifully Delicious...my face is glued to my laptop...mouth-watering... Yum yum :-)
<3
Is your coconut ginger and mango dairy free? :D
I'm your 10,000th like! :D
Dear Gelato Messina at The Star - I would like to apologise for taking up so much of the valuable time of your staff two weekends ago.. But this is clearly your fault !!!! So many awesome flavours to choose from - and it was my first time - So the decision was very difficult to make... Thank you for your patience in allowing me so much time to make up my mind.. You could possible help out your patrons by not making all your flavours so AWESOME and YUMMY but that would just be anti-Messina. Till next time... Mia <3 
I'm hanging out for a mandarine sorbet....when is one going to be available guys? Need to know when to send Adam down!! (Still in hospital or I'd come down too!!!) Thanks God for Facebook! lol
Our afternoon tea was amazing today.  Thanks Gelato Messina x
Open a Messina's on the Northern Beaches please! :)
Will you have peanut butter gelato today???:) craving it really bad!
bring back fudge this!so amazing!xx
Christian says...bring back "Elvis the fat years flavour!!" thank you :-)
my gorgeous pal Erica Valenti had the mushroom ice cream cake for her birthday on Sat and it was amazing!!!
Today we tasted the pavlova, WOW, yum yum yum. You guys are amazing.
I'm on my way to come see you...!... :D
I LOVE YOU!  Thanks for last night! It was incredible! ;)

A truly HUGE day spent styling, Westfield Sydney so fabulous to have so many amazing brands all under one very chic roof. Calibre a huge thank you to the team in store for your help today. SABA always so helpful. LOVECK Calvin Klein the new mens collection and those red pants L O V E!Tomorrow is going to be just as big......
Dear Westfield Bondi Junction. Please stop moving the public seating in your centre. And why do you replace seats with backs for those without? I'm not sure you realise how difficult this makes it to plan a trip with an elderly person with mobility issues. My Dad is 83 and has difficulty walking long distances. But it is good for him to get out and move - and his favourite outing is going to your centre for a coffee and to see other people. But, every time we think we've worked out where the seats are, you move them or change them to flat benches, which he can't sit on. Now, it may not seem like much of a problem, but there are very few places with easy access, disabled parking and a range of activities for someone with limited mobility. We stopped going to Eastgardens because of a lack of public seating. Now, I can't sit him outside Coles at Bondi Junction while I help Mum shop, because you've removed appropriate seating. And today, we reached a point where there were seats recently, only to find them gone. He was forced to sit on his walker until he regained his strength enough for us to go searching for a seat. It's frustrating and makes Dad anxious. We may be among only a few who feel this is a problem - I suspect not.

Finally, a decent cafe just down the road - brilliant! :)
very excited for you to open. :)
Cornersmith, has anyone shown you a photo of how your cafe looked in its previous incarnation selling industrial yarn spools to all the Vietnamese sweatshops?  The multicoloured windows were a true Marrickville landmark for decades.  It would be great for you to hang a photo of its previous life... ;)
See you this afternoon for more Mulberry picking, yes?yay :)
Check out this delightful blog post on Grab Your Fork about Cornersmith! We get a mention too :)

High time for people to step up and save Charlie from unjustice. SF rulers condamned him to death, because he had an encounter with a policeman on a horse in an of-leach-dog-parc ?!?! This is not about Charlie, this is about psycho's having the power over "the weak", over innocent lives, and the kick of destroying it just because they can ...... !!!!!! This says a lot about SF rulers, they are a danger for all living beings ! They say Charlie is still alive, kept in a concentration camp, waiting to be murdered, and they think they can get away with it. These psycho's have no limits, they won't stop making innocent victims. Step up for the voiceless and help free CHARLIE <3 http://www.facebook.com/HelpSaveCharlie?ref=ts&fref=ts

Field Mushroom Stack - Poached eggs smothered in basil cream on top of a house made crispy potato rosti, oven roasted field mushrooms, tomato and sliced avocado. Yep. Amazing.
Hi, Adam here & I was checking out your food pics...amazing!! Could you imagine these pics in front of 100s > 1000s of hungry Melbourne folk ( not just Facebook followers: ) exactly when they're looking for a place to eat?....well we‚Äôre building it! Please just ‚Äòlike‚Äô our page if you‚Äôre interested!
The New Orleans iced coffee with soy is epic, but the breakfast here is also amazing (poached eggs on toast). If you can't stay for breakfast, get the granola. Best ever.
Visit this famous beach. We recommend watching the sun rise over the sea ‚Äì absolutely spectacular. Swim at the end of Summer to enjoy the warmer water :)
Wings are now $0.50 on Tuesday. Still an awesome deal! Try the spicy garlic if you're not a vampire. :)
Double pass give away:I'm a Belgian girl who just arrived back in Sydney a month ago and I just LOVE Cargo Bar!! A day at the races and then Cargo, perfect to get to know even more people who love Cargo!! ;-)
I LOVE CARGO BAR & WLD DEF LIKE TO PARTY THERE FOR THE LAUNCH OF GOOD CHARLOTTE'S NEW ALBUM , I HAVE LOVED THE BAND SINCE I WAS YOUNGER BUT THE NEW ALBUM IS DEFINATELY MY FAVORITE :)PLEASE CHOOSE ME FOR THIS EVENT , IT WILL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER :)
Thank you Cargo bar and a very special thanks to one of your staff members Elise as she gave more than excellent service but also new to Sydney she gave me one of the most amazing and memorable nights of my life. Thank you Elise and Cargo Bar for hiring such an amazing person!
A huge thank you to Alice Forbes for contacting me about my iPhone I had left at the cargo bar last week, thank you also to Michael Ternes for keeping it safe and a big thank you to all the staff for being so honest and professional :) 
Less than a week left to grab your tickets to the Mikee Collins support night at Cargo Bar next Monday evening. An amazing auction line up and 100% of proceeds will be gifted to Mikee to help provide financial support for his medical and living expenses.
A well made mojito is my all time favourite cocktail (and ernest hemingways!) because it ticks all my boxes of what a great drink should be - it's presented amazingly, it tastes incredible and without fail, a night on mojitos will be one to remember!!The balance of mint and zest of lime, kick of rum and the sweetness of the sugar makes it irressistable, and because there are so many variations (like muddling pineapple instead of lime and adding some pineapple juice - my second favourite!!), everyone can find a version that they love, and you can always freestyle and mix it up when you feel like a change - its pretty much impossible to screw up!To make it: muddle a handfull of fresh mint with lime wedges and sugar, then add a little extra fresh lime juice and two shots of white rum. Shake it with ice, then serve it in an highball glass, top it up with soda and pop a lime wheel, swizzle stick and mint on top - tastes insanely good!!
Big Week ahead... get ready for the Party tunes!WED: playing Wednesdays @ The Eastern 10:30-12FRI: debuting at Cargo Bar 11:30-1 - Come check itttSAT: smashing it out at The Usual Suspects 10:30-12 yew.
thinks good charlotte are amazing!!! and Benji is sex on legs :) being there for the album launch would complete my life <3
Make sure you go to Grill'd, best burgers I've ever had. Other good shops, sweet as, borders, apple store & they have great cinemas (village) :)

::: A smile cost nothing but gives much . It enriches those who receive without making poorer those who give . It takes but a moment but the memory of it sometimes last forever . None is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it N none is so poor but that he can made rich by it . A smile creates Happiness in the home , foster's good will in business N is the countersign of friendship . It brings rest to the weary , cheer to the discouraged , sunshine to the sad N it nature's best antidote for trouble . Yet it cannot be bought , begged , borrowed or stolen for it is something that is of No value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tried to give u a smile . Give them one of urS , as none needs a smile as much as he who has not more to give . :)* :::

I've never been anywhere in the world that has street artists as #TALENTED as the ones in #Sydney a I had the pleasure of meeting another #AMAZING illustrator by the name of James Kite! It's always a breath of fresh air to converse with fellow fine arts activists! He had very kind things to say about my portfolio, and awesome words of encouragement pertaining to the field! He even drew a pic for me & signed it! This entire piece of his he constructed solely with #BICpens! ‚úí #SALUTE to true talent of #ART üé®

Late lunch date - yummy fresh produce & Mecca coffee :)
Lunchtime :)
Dukkah roasted eggplant with chickpeas, greens, sumac yoghurt and slow roasted lamb shoulder. This was under the sandwich section. Lamb was melting, eggplant also, flavours amazing, tang from yoghurt was refreshing, texture from chickpeas, crispy wrap, and an orange relish - capsicum or something? That was sooo tasty. Really loved this whole dish, best cafe dish I've had in a while.

Dark chocolate gelato covers a centre of dulce de leche which sits upon peanut butter cookie.

The arrival of some waves of size was a welcome surprise this morning. And the breeze is light, so while its not offshore, it's pretty clean and there's no one out at Bronte. The swell is pushing through from the south again and breaking such that the left and right are both working. Must be 3ft+ on the sets. Tama has a few out. It's not amazing but it's much better than we've seen it in a while so get out there. #thebrontereport #bronte #surfreport

Maybe looks can be deceiving. I walked down this morning to find Bronte looking a little wind beaten (it's turned easterly) and overcast, but there are waves. It's 2-3ft and while choppy, 3 guys are out here already getting a fun right-hander off the reef. If you missed out yesterday and are itching for a wave it's not amazing but you'll probably get your fix. #Bronte #surfreport #easterly #choppy

HELLO from your biggest fan!!!! how are you? Declan told me about the amazing mouthwatering creations you've been creating, blueberry, licorice!! YUM YUM YUM!!! you just don't stop hey!! i've decided that you Nick are a gelato genius!! (and i hope i'm giving credit to to right person!! hi Danny!!) i've also decided that you should be knighted, so as soon as i find the queen on stalkbook i will start my petition! hehe! Can i ask you a favour? Could you please ship me some pistaccio (excuse my poor spelling) and hazelnut gelato,i'm struggling without it, it's been too long! hehehe! am sending you ALL the biggest smiles, hope you're finding time for hugs and sunshine!! all my love, monXOXOX
The only thing you're missing here is at least a basic menu of the permanents and then somewhere where u can update us with the daily "specials" ....I'm actually IN hospital at St Vinnies after a Heart Transplant and I don't know what to ask for when hubby comes to get me one! Feedback: My mum's late uncle used to be a pastry chef and made the he made the best gelato apparently (in Melb), and mum & my Nonna reckon yours is very similar...they have fallen in love with YOU...they are having more than they are giving me while they are in town. We are not local! Two thumbs up! White Christmas was oh so yummy and should be around every christmas....open up a franchise in Orange please? Big Italian community there and plenty of Aussies who love Italian sweets! Just a thought! xxoo
Can we request some specials to have again because they look so super awesome and delicious and I missed out on trying them :(Any or ALL of these would be amazingly awesome!!!SELLEY'SNUMBER TWORAFFAELLOPEANUT BUTTER BROWNIECOCO LOCOTHE LITTLE BLOKEPEANUT BUTTER CHEESECAKEARACHIDI BIANCATHE SLABROCOCOPEANUT BUTTER FLORENTINEPS.Sorry about the long list..its the result of what I like to call "Highly effective procrastination!"
Hi GM, we're hearing mad things about your gelato flavours back in Adelaide - we have a little macaron shop on Hutt street. Rumour has it you hail from citrus and the green olive.....? If you still see Eugiene, tell him Silvana says 'hi' :)
Holy mother of god Gelato Messina, mushrooms were never cuter nor tastier <3
can you please consider doing an ambrosia pudding, boysenberry (or any other berry) parfait or anything with condensed milk flavour? obviously i am ruled by a sweet tooth ;)
would love it if you could get a better service system happening. came in the other night and queued up politely and people just pushed past us into the shop and got served way before we did. It is always worth the wait for your gelato, but annoying at the same time to see people jump the queue. maybe a ticket system would be best, at the door..or a bouncer!! LOL
hi there I was just wanna request a average but delectable flavor for you guys to bring back .....cookies and cream!!!! it's the best!!! oh and my friend asked to suggest orange sorbet pleeeaaaaseee thankyou :)
Hi gelato Messina,I would just like to let you know that your staff are always friendly and so wonderful.It's always an enjoyable experience to enjoy such a tasty, high quality product after being served by your staff members!Keep up the great work :)!
Hey Messina - there's a Turkish cafe in Auburn called Mado Cafe that does 'chewy' ice cream it's called dondurma, and it would be pretty spanking awesome if you could make a flavour with it :)

To all the coffee lovers in Sydney, our friends at Single Origin Roasters are donating $1 from every coffee sold tomorrow to support Cafesmart of StreetSmart Australia who endeavour to fight homelessness. Help out by buying a coffee tomorrow! See event for more details. https://www.facebook.com/events/328078303953703/Any other cafes out there supporting the appeal?
3squared at Single Origin Roasters with Joanne Villacruz was amazing.  The tartare of salmon, yuzu and baby sorrel leaves was one of the best mini mouthfuls I've ever had, the siphoned  Liquidambar Estate is like a crush that I can't/won't shake (I heart Liquidambar doodled everywhere) and the La Chapparal ris was like melted gold.  Look it up - if you haven't been yet, book in now as it's the best $10 you will spend this year.  If you have been, book in again - we'll come with you.

What do you see? God asked. Do you know how many times in the bible God asked "what do you see?" to His people? (Zec5:2; Ams8:2; Jer1:13; Jer24:3; ...) I believed the reason why God keep asking His people because He want us imagine our victory. - "When you can see it, you can achieve it." "What you see determines who you are." - blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which  is  on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. (Genesis 22:17 NKJV) God wants Abraham to imagine that his descendants will be as much as the sand and the stars, thus when the enemy try to steal Abraham's hope, Abraham just need to see the sand and the start with an imagination that one day God's promise will come to pass, Amen.

Life itself is a most amazing thing. Just to realise that could make us all sing. Why can't the red, yellow, black and white stop this fighting and learn to unite. Put down your guns and make all this horror cease. If you truly love your children, you'll do it for them, for they are our future. #thinkaboutit #beautiful #bondibeach #sydney

#Day4:¬† Today is been a long day,¬† but a good one as well.¬† All day chilling out in Surfers Paradise,¬† the "city" is crowded of skyscrapers next to the beach,¬† artificial rivers,¬† 7km of coast to walk along the beach and the awesome 77 floor skyscraper called Q1. I've been waiting on te top of the building to see the sunset,¬† amazing views of the place from there.¬† Now I'm in the bus station waiting for go to Brisbane,¬† I will probably stay there 2 or 3 days,¬† let's see! // Hoy a sido un largo d√≠a,¬† pero un muy buen dia igualmente. Relajandome en Surfers Paradise,¬† la "ciudad"¬† esta llena de rascacielos junto a la costa,¬† r√≠os arrificiales, 7 kms de costa en los que andar junto a la playa y el incre√≠ble rascacielos de 77 plantas llamado Q1. He estado en la cima del edificio esperando a la puesta de sol,¬† asombrosas vistas desde all√≠. Ahora estoy en la estaci√≥n de autobuses esperando para ir a Brisbane,¬† probablemente estar√© alli 2 o 3 d√≠as, ¬°Ya veremos!

Lol
2012 really has been a full year, spent plenty of time with awesome people, met a whole lot of new people, bonded with those I consider close to me, drank a whole lot of alcohol, partied hard, worked hard, created heaps of memories, said bye to some friends and welcomed in some new ones, learnt some things about my self as well as others, looking forward to more of the same next year.. With a few surprises I'm sure :) Bring on 2013!#happynewyear #memories #friends #partytime #nye13 #timetodrink

1.12.12 Good Morning everyone. I'm on a bit of a high. Up at 4:30am this morning, down the beach at 4:45 for a 6 km run then some gorgeous sunrise shots. This one in particular has me very surprised. I saw the water sparkling like tiny diamonds so I thought I take a shot...and I got a multiple carot diamond sun with natural flare. Seriously, a truly lucky shot...with a boarder thrown in for added effect! This is my #firstdayofsummer shot!
Surfers Paradise at night. The place this photo was taken was pitch dark the but it's the most beautiful and spectacular scene I've ever been too. Only things that are visible and feel are night lights from hotels (the photo), the white ripples from the waves, seagulls flying above the sea that looked like fireflies, sound of the waves, sea breeze, the soft fine cold sand and LOTS OF STARS. Someday I'll bring you here. Whoever you are in the future;)

Gold coast :DD
So chill <3
Beach Day :)
Watching the sunrise!! :D
Watching/perving lol üòù
The perfect sunrise. I always meter my camera before the sun is up and use those settings in manual mode once it's up so the bright light of the sun doesn't trick my light meter. Bracketing helps as well, I do three shots with a full stop difference. If all of this is gobbledygook just point your device at sunrise and shoot. It always looks beautiful at this time of the day. :)
#shellporn I couldn't bear to filter it, definitely a current favorite. :)
Just finished work :) Totally love the view!
We live in such a lovely place :)
Amazing day!
This is better - beautiful day :) #goldcoast

Dessert time! If you're ever going for a dinner on the Gold Coast and specially in Surfers, you have to go to "Black Coffee Lyrics"! This is my absolute favorite restaurant here. The food is amazing and beautiful (You have to have the eye fillet!), the service is excellent and relaxed, there is a wooden floor and book shells on the walls and good music:) Not typical GC at all and that's why I love it even more. And, this is where RJ and I had our first date;) #bcl #blackcoffeelyrics #dessert #dinner

Hi Surfers Paradise Community, please could you post this for the theatre going community...THE DROWSY CHAPERONE at Spotlight Theatre, Benowa I was lucky enough to see a preview last night and WOW!! This is a must, must see show. The performances are up to the usual Spotlight Theatre amazingly high standards, the costumes are fabulous and sets really clever! Drowsy Chaperone opens Friday 17th May and runs until 8th June. Go to www.spotlighttheatre.com.au to book tickets The Drowsy Chaperone, dubbed ‚Äòa comedy within a musical‚Äô will hit the Spotlight Theatre stage from May 17 with a dynamic cast for the show‚Äôs Queensland premiere. The story begins in the living room of the unnamed ‚ÄòMan in the Chair‚Äô - played by Peter Maden - a Broadway fanatic who decides to soothe his ‚Äònon-specific sadness‚Äô by listening to his favourite record, a fictional 1928 musical ‚ÄòThe Drowsy Chaperone‚Äô - a gloriously campy romp.

South Pacific matinee today was fantastic - Gyton Grantley stole the show along with Christine Anu.. both fabulous. And the guy who played Lieutenant Cable (I believe was the understudy) was amazing!! (And gorgeous!!) 
Hi QPAC. Was just wondering why I can't select my own seats for Legally Blonde? I have been able to select my own for the Legally Blonde shows I have already booked but this is not available now.  Will this option be available again soon? Thanks :)
Loved the production of Driving Miss Daisy, cast amazing.  Coup for Queenslanders to have the access to this level of theatre.

I went and saw End of the Rainbow yesterday at the playhouse theatre, and I would like to really say Thank you too all the staff yesterday that helped me out. The readiness and helpfulness took a lot of stress out of my day and would like to that particular a duty manager (I think was his title) called Paul who offered to hold my friends ticket and water bottle so I could enter the theatre. Its honestly the best service I have received anywhere, and I am extremely grateful. Tell Paul he's Awesome haha :)

Life before QPAC ... :)
Loved Jersey Boys matinee yesterday at QPAC. Excellent seats. My friend and I had a whole row to ourselves for the first act! I've never seen that before. Food from The Cafe was fabulous :)
Thank you all so much for giving me the opportunity to do work experience last week! I had a great time, can't wait to share some of my new light & sound knowledge! :)
Just booked for Jersey Boys on Wednesday night!! Looking forward to our combined birthdays and anniversary pressie :) 
Went to see Jersey Boys today.  What a fantastic show!  Flew from Mackay just to see the show and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Connor Crawford was brilliant as Frankie and the rest of the cast were amazing.  Many thanks to Connor and Declan for posing for a photo for me!!  Loved it!!!   
Good morning QPAC,I was wondering if you knew when the tickets for the last two weeks of Jersey Boys were likely to go on sale. I really want to go to the final Brisbane performance. I assume it will be the 14 October at 6:30pm?Many thanksKristen
trying to organise my Music folder and need to know what songs we (QPAC Choir) will be performing tomorrow and what order if possible please? O:-)
Is there going to be a presale for Legally Blonde? So excited :)
I can not find a price for a consession to A Chorus Line, can anyone help ? I went though to odering tickets and it didnt give me an option to change from Adult to consession.I really want to take my nan :)
Just wanted to say what an AWESOME matinee show Jersey Boys was today.  The cast were fantastic and while we had an understudy Frankie it didn‚Äôt make a difference because his performance was outstanding!  I‚Äôd highly recommend the show to anyone and would love to see it again :)
i'm going to see "a chorus line" today.Looking forward to it :).I read on the qpac site that there is no interval.is that correct?
This week we had a Creative Talk with Patrick Pickett, CEO of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. Hear it all firsthand...from a past job that was a significant feature in Patrick‚Äôs career to what his amazing current role is really like.
Just saw Kelly. Thanks for an amazing performance! Script, production and execution were all fantastic.
Since when it is ok for patrons to be loudly munching on chips and lollies through a theatre show? Way to ruin the experience of seeing A Chorus Line for everyone in the vicinity. 
Thank you QPAC for my surprise in the post today. The dvd set of The Rock Show. I recently rocked out to The Rock Revolution with Jon English and cast at Nambour Civic Centre and loved it. I will now very much enjoy rocking to The Rock Show...thanks heaps <3 
I'd like to thank the sound guy at the Wunder Bar for passing along my friends card. You seriously are one awesome dude :D x
Booked tickets to see Bill Bailey in September yesterday morning, they were in my mailbox when I got home tonight! Well done QPAC, amazing delivery time! Much appreciated <3
Hi, just wondering if there are any plans for the Legally Blonde The Musical Australia - Official Site to secure a season at QPAC this year?  :-)
Hi QPAC, do you still do backstage tours?  I couldn't find anything about them on the website.  Cheers :)
Happy birthday QPAC!  And it's extra special for me due to you!  This afternoon I met the fabulous Anthony Warlow as he was entering Stage Door to play in "Annie".  We chatted for about 15 minutes, which was so unexpected.  What a gracious and generous man, not only with his time but also his demeanour.  It's easy to understand why he is loved and respected by so many.  And he organised for a photo of the two of us - which was the icing on the cake.  So that was my birthday present FROM you!  Thanks and hope you have a great one :)
Happy birthday QPAC! I'm from Townsville and my first show there was Mary Poppins in late jan. I then went back in march to watch it again!! Thanks for an awesome experience! Happy celebrating :)
Thanks heaps QPAC - it was my birthday yesterday and I came home to find an envelope in the mail from you today containing two tickets for "Delicacy" - what a lovely surprise!  Seeing "Romeo & Juliet" on Friday night, "Annie" on Sunday, Qld Pops Orchestra with Rachel Beck and John Steinlake on the 19th May and now this!  Life's pretty great and a lot of it is thanks to you :)
Just been to see Mary Poppins on Broadway in New York, although the show was very good, it paled in comparrison to our Aussie cast, also the Amsterdam Theatre wasn't nearly as comfortable as The Lyric.Saw Sister Act the other night, now that was fabulous, loved it, hope this show comes to the Lyric :) going to see Mama Mia & The Phantom Of The Opera to compare the shows to our Australian productions, have seen Mama Mia at the Lyric and loved it, also have seen The Phantom 4 times, twice in Melbourne ans twice in Brissie, this will be our 5th time, I'm sure it won't be as good as ours though.
Hi, from a little bird :)
I went to the matinee performance of Annie today,i saw Mary Poppins recently,I AM ADDICTED the musicals have been brilliant moving and amazing both times!and my !16 year old daughter enjoyed them and the experience too.QPAC outstanding,thank you.
My mum loved Petula Clark on Saturday night in the Concert Hall. It was her Christmas present from me :)
Hi Qpac peeps.   Took my Mum along to see MP.   I have a few things that I need to say!!   Awesome, amazing, brilliant, fantastic ... Amazing.. Oh wait... I already used that one.   ;)Thank you so much for your help with this.  Mum does have a bad hip but the seating in O were great seats.  The railing actually helped her sit down and pull herself up. And doesn't obstruct view.  It was a brilliant show and she (and I) can't stop talking about it.  Best birthday present ever.I think you guys get a hard time sometimes, but personally I believe you guys do what you can to help.   And I thank you again. Qpac is Practically perfect on every way ;). Xo 
Hello.  Could you please explain why it is that tickets to Romeo and Juliet by the Australian Ballet are advertised as "From $33" But the very back seats on the second balcony - the worst seats in the house - on a Wednesday at 6:30, a very impractical day and time to go -  are priced at $102.Logically these should be the cheapest seats in the entire theater, so could you explain why they are 3 times the advertised price, as this is incredibly misleading.
Hi :) sent from A Little Bird
HI, I am wishing to see Mary soon and was just checking if you guys offer the practically perfect encore class or something similar? :) Thanks 
i had a slight glitch with some merchandise from Mary Poppins but some amazing seriously AMAZING work was done by QPAC staff to rectify it ever so fast.THANK YOU!!!!!!!we have paid and booked for the Annie performance today,so will be bacvk in your beautiful spot again soon!thank you ,Natalie .Delbridge
Had a fantastic day today thanks to QPAC, Opera Australia and The Queensland Symphony Orchestra!  Lunch at the Lyrebird Restaurant, which was superb, then off to a performance of The Magic Flute!  Amazing! My daughter and I had the best time...her first opera!  She is hooked!! Thanks again QPAC for the opportunity!
Loved opening night for Wizard of Oz - excellent production and everything went off very well! Every comment I heard as I was leaving was positive! Well worth seeing. Well done Kathryn as Aunty Em :) 
Absolutely loved Annie, the set, orchestra and cast were amazing but the show was stolen by the incredibly talented Chloe Thiel who was sensational as Annie
Hellooo... From A Little Bird <3
Chookas 2 the Mary Poppins cast & crew for the last performance in Brisbane!!! :D we love you & will miss the MP spirit around QPAC! Xxxx
Happy Birthday! Best theatre:) xx
Hi there, I love coming to QPAC and I saw Mary Poppins recently and it was amazing. Decided I wanted to head back to see it with four other family members so tried to book tickets. There were hardly any five seats left in the stalls, but I found some online and tried to book. It wouldn't let me book them because it would have left one seat next to us. These were pretty much the only decent seats left together for the rest of the run and at $132 each, it was SO frustrating we couldn't buy them because the system wouldn't let us, even though I could see there were other single seats left dotted around. I called up to try and book through the call centre, but they wouldn't book them either. I eventually ended up getting five together for a night we didn't really want, simply because it was all there was. Just wanted to say that as a regular QPAC customer, I thought this was pretty poor and I've ended up paying the same price for much worse seats. Thanks.
Newest liker from Girlylicious Oh-So-Sweet and saying hi from A Little Bird <3 who sent me in your direction xx <3 <3
Bloodland last night was AMAZING, loved it. 
Thank you for the double pass to see Man on a Ledge!!!! Much appreciated! Going this weekend :D
We're off to Alice in Wonderland at QPAC April, Friday 13th.  Hope the Tea Party doesn't get spoilt because of the day/date..    Maybe all the upside downness will be rite way 'round for this show.  ;)
Hi from a Little Bird :)

Thanks to the whole QPAC team for participating in Brisbane Open House today. Thanks especially to Nick who took our backstage tour and also to Keith and Carly who took our Grand Organ Tour, they were fantastic! QPAC front of house staff are always amazing and today was no exception, but it was so great to meet some of the people who make it all happen behind the scenes. One of my favourite theatre-going memories now, and I didn't even see a show!
i am so looking forward to seeing "mary poppins" tomorrow.I'm sure it will be amazing!
Congratulations to the Imperial Russian Ballet...Amazing show tonight! :-)
Are any more shows for Mary Poppins going to be released or is it closing on the 26th of February? Also, any chance of a lottery like with Wicked? :)

Wondering what was going on with parking @ QPAC last night (22 Oct). Arrived at complex with 30 minutes to spare only to find every single carpark (including State Library!) FULL! Never experienced anything like it in the 10 years we've been attending the opera... except for the floods earlier this year of course ;-) What was going on that parking was so limited?
Just wanted to express how much I enjoyed Spring Awakening - I would have paid double what I did to see it. Excellent casting and performances, I say bring it back for another season! :)
I'm so excited to be performing this amazing Adele song at Chartbusters 2 with the Queensland Pops Orchestra at QPAC in just ten days' time - if you haven't booked your tickets for this fantastic concert, get in quick! www.qpac.com.au

Last night went to see Tosca. The cast gave such an amazing performance. It will be a night I will never forget.
Miriam Margolyes performing Dickens characters looks to be an interesting show. Looking at ticket prices it offers one for concessions, but not Seniors. So Senior Card or Pension Card doesnt apply? As a Senior I am unemployed!!! LOL 
just got told Charlie and Lola QPAC is open now for purchase EEK!! (also dont forget about Dorothy the dinosaur which goes on sale today)
Stolen was truly amazing. Well done Leah Purcell, cast & crew.
Hi QPAC do you know when the tickets for David Campbell go on sale?? Thank you for your assistance.  Deb :)
Mary Poppins was absolutely Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, what a fantastic show, anyone with children or grandchildren to take would love this, the show is just beautiful, not unlike Harry Potter really in the way you feel after you've seen it, some of the children there tonight just loved it, guess it's another one to add to broadway. lol
Can't wait for Charlie & Lola!!

An insanely brilliant performance of Schubert, Mahler and Beethoven. Thanks to Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and all the people at Qpac for an amazing evening.
Is Hairspray the Musical definitely not coming to Brisbane? Such a shame! I saw it in Sydney and thought it was amazing. Just as good as Mary Poppins in my opinion!

First Justine Clarke, now Angelina... and soon Charlie & Lola.. quite the year of shows for my little miss. She's going to be so excited. Caroline Taylor
I've just joined this page so my post is late but I want to add my two bits to the mix. Dr Zhivago - A New Musical left my heart soaring at the perfect clarity of lyrics & melody which gives new life to such a tragic story written so long ago.  Anthony Warlow & Lucy Maunder's voices are exquisite & weave together a magnificent tapestry as this hauntingly beautiful story unfolds from their lips & hearts.  The entire creative teams & cast are to be congratulated on a remarkable body of work.  I've seen many musicals but this one has captured my heart & soul like no other.  After seeing it four times in Brisbane, including the final Aussie performance, I feel as though I am grieving the loss of a beloved family member now that it has finished its run.  I miss sitting in a darkened theatre & being transported to a Russia of long ago.  Sincere & heartfelt thanks to Lucy Simon, Amy Powers & Michael Korie for an amazing interpretation of Boris Pasternak's wonderful story.
Saw MP on Saturday. Absolutely magical and fantastic performances by a stellar cast :)
Absolutely appalled at our treatment at last Thursday's Charlie & Lola performance, our seats had been taken and instead of the persons being asked to move, we were shoved into the next available seats.  Given that this would be the point of seat allocation, we were very disappointed. 
G'day went and saw Mary Poppins today, it was amazing.  Lovely songs, lovely dancing, and excellent acting.  The stage setup and set changes were fantastic and went so smoothly.  Would love to go and see it again.
A Little Bird told me about Angelina Ballerina :)
Wunder Bar is the official after-party of Brisbane Festival and this Friday it's our very own Batucada Sound Machine. Don't miss the dynamic 10-piece mixing Brazilian rhythms, funk, hip-hop, reggae, dub and Pacific soul - FREE from 8:30pm in QPAC's Cascade Court!
Saw Rock of Ages this afternoon - brilliant show - congrats to the cast and crew :)
An amazing performance from everyone at Wicked. The cast were fabulous, the lighting outstanding and the music sensational! I would love to see the show in a different area of the theatre for contrast...but wow! Wow! And wow! Thank you so much! Great theatre!
When does Annie start in Brisbane. Wanting to plan a trip with family around it :)
Dr Zhivago was the most incredible, touching, tragic, compelling and brilliant musical I have seen in a long time. I was a total mess after the compelling ending of the act 2, it left me in tears. The intricate story, incredible performances by Warlow and Maunder left me speechless and I will be returning or a second coming. Every production element was perfect and I praise every member behind this musical, for producing a Broadway standard piece. So saddened about the fact a CD will not be produced, this angered many people in the audience around me when I notified them. I wish to live the experience forever!However, this will not detract from my opinion of this outstanding piece. Thank you QPAC for hosting a world class musical! You've really done it this year with Wicked and now Zhivago :)
I love u QPAC :)
Saw Dr. Zhivago on Thursday night. It was amazing. Anthony Warlow never fails to impress. Highly recommend people to see it.On another note, is QI Live coming too Qpac? I read somewhere it was but find no info on the site. Say it is, for I have the biggest crush on Stephen Fry and QI is hilarious.

Hi :)Is there any way to find out if Jemma Rix is performing the 3pm show of WICKED on Sunday the 27th of March?
Thanks to QPAC for hosting an amazing season of Wicked!! <3
Hi guys, the Convention Centre carparks were all full when I came for the Wicked Matin√©e today. I sprinted from the Southbank carpark but was two minutes late. Your two ladies down near door 7 were just lovely, and I waited and chatted with them until the end of the first song. Another wonderful QPAC experience! (The $24 parking at Southbank was not my favourite part though, hope the Cultural Centre carparks are open again soon :-) )
At QPAC about to see Harvest Rain TheatreCo's Fam & friends of JCS. Chookas Paul Watson, Naomi Price, Luke Kennedy - Official Fan Page et al. Also Chookas to Nick Christo also at QPAC tonight. Big <3

QPAC is the best entertainment venue in Brisbane :-)
I bought my WICKED tickets in July last year and finally saw it last night! It was so worth the extended wait!! An absolutely fantastic show! Lucy and Jemma were amazing, Bert and Maggie - fantastic! and the rest of the cast superb! A special mention must go to the great group of people working so hard behind the scenes! The sets were fantastic and lighting and sound astounding! Also, QPAC you deserve a big pat on the back for your extreme efforts in getting everything up and running! Thank you all so much!
Does anyone know why Lucy Durack (Galinda from Wicked) doesn't come out stage door anymore? A friend went and saw the show twice in 2 days and Lucy didn't come out, Jemma Rix said Lucy rarely comes out stage door but I wanna know why cause I really wanna fly up to Brisbane again but I wanna get her to sign a program. I'd love if you could tell me :)
Wicked <3, so good yesterday
Going to see Wicked again on Tuesday night and I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to thank Cathy personally for her incredible dedication to the public and indescribable patience during the floods. Haven't forgotten. I must find you!!!! :D
DR ZHIVAGO WAS AWESOME!!! GREAT SHOW, WELL DONE QPAC FOR SECURING SUCH A MASTERPIECE! :-D
Grease is the word!  What an amazing show.  Looking forward to hearing if Mary Poppins comes to QPAC.  
Cat on a hot tin roof was fantastic:) thank you
went to the Celtic Celebration last night! Was an Amazing experience thank you QPAC and the Queensland POPS Orchestra! It was a fantastic unforgettable night! 
Hello, I purchased Alice in Wonderland tickets for my friends 21st for her & I when they went on sale last year. Then the flooding happened and everything was postponed. I am yet to get a phone call about it being postponed to April 19/20 (I read that) and today $74.95 was credited to my bank account! I just wondered what that means, because I had good seats and would hate to miss out on them for when we see the performance ... If you could get back to me asap that would be much appreciated :) 
Are there any plans for a green carpet after the Wicked finale? Or anything else special? Thanks :-)
kenny wizz :)
R&J was so amazing the other week! Cant wait for saturday to see cabaret!! 
Saw Dr. Zhivago last nite. Amazing show, amazing cast and the set was out of this world, so innovative and the story had such complexity. I would like to seen more of Brisbane in those empty seats though. Nothing like a full house to turn the atmosphere electric. Great work QPAC!!!!
Hello QPAC ! Not sure if you have the resources there, but it would be great to have your current events and competitions posted as Facebook events. Fans can then add them as "maybe" attending to remind them of what's on before it's too late :-)
Thank you for the amazing entertainment you provide us with in Brisbane ...
we saw wicked on saturday night 2nd balcony up top, its was amazing, congratulate yourselves for a job well done, might have had a bit of a walk to the car park at BCC and no problems with our prepaid parking ticket, superb dinner at kapsali, south bank parklands and good service from paula the waitress, what a great birthday present i hadthankyou 
hiya! :) is there any new yet on when the whitlams & QSO shows might be back on? i haven't heard anything yet, & they were meant to be 21/22 jan, so just thought i'd ask! :)
Thanks QPAC. Wicked was amazing! Saw it last night and it was amazing... :D thank you.
saw wicked from the front row this arvo!!! OMG I could touch the stage it was amazing!!
saw wicked last night... it was AMAZING! thanks to everyone involved for all the hard work getting the show up and running! 
Hi guys, we came to see the amazing Wicked last night and were very impressed (especially by Jemma Rix!), however the older members of our group were quite disappointed to not see Bert Newton or Maggie Kirkpatrick and that there was no notice of this. Don't you usually announce at the beginning of the show if there are replacements? Considering the program and all the marketing has these guys as part of the Brisbane cast, we were a bit taken aback. Also, is there an Australian recording? We bought the soundtrack but would prefer to hear those great voices again!
Hi I had tickets to see Wicked on the 23rd and I called when I found out about opening night on the 25th so I called and a lovely lady said that you guys were sorting out rescheduling and to expect a call in the next couple of days or so I tried calling 3 times but I was put on hold for 20mins. I understand that this is unfortunate disaster to occur to our beloved sunshine state and i think the efforts to get things back on track have been admirable, but some feedback about rescheduling/refunding would be greatThanks :)
I just want to say thank you to the amazing girl on the qtix line for helping me out this afternoon. My phone cut out mid way through and called me straight back on my other phone line.  I'm sorry I was in such a rush and can't remember your name but I am so grateful and so excited to have my wicked tickets!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quick question- I went to the Tuesday Matinee performance of Wicked (LOVED IT) and am now kicking myself for not buying the mug! I am up from Melbourne and was wondering if the "shop" is open throughout the day or only just before/during the show each night? My sister works around the corner and I was hoping she could pick one up for me after finishing work. Thank you for your help! :)
Just got a callThankyou so much to much Brad for the fantastic service!!!!Was able to reschedule everything perfectly :D
Hi, I have tickets for the nighttime performance of WICKED on Tuesday 1st of Feb. Has that performance been rescheduled, or will it go ahead as planned?Thanks for putting this page up, by the way. :)
OMG!! WICKED! was well....WICKED! I had never seen it as we have a 17mth old child so couldnt afford to fly/travel  anywhere with him AND a babysitter so we waited patiently in the hope that maybe ONE DAY it would come to Brissy....friends told us that it NEVER would due to the set size so I couldnt believe it when I found out it was coming. We werent able to afford expensive tickets (saw it yesterday arvo from the front row of balcony 3) but WHO CARES?!?!?!? WE WERE THERE!!! I wanna go again!!!! BEST SHOW I've ever seen!!! Even the hubby loved it!! LOL xxx
Hey QpacSeen wicked a couple of weeks ago it  was amazing !!!!I was just wondering if Hairspray will came to brisbane when its finshed in melbourne  Thanks.....  :)
Just wanted to let you guys know you've been doing an AMAZING job with updates and communication on here, and I'm sure all involved are very appreciative of your efforts under such trying conditions. Very proud of you all!Break a leg! Happy Australia Day from Adelaide!
i saw Wicked tonight and it was so good!!! Especially Elphaba <3
Thank you qpac! going to see WICKED on the 11th :D can't wait!!!
Yes, please go and have an after-show drink, rather than returning to the Convention Centre Carpark immediately. 'Twas not possible to exit the carpark until 40 mins after the performance finished this evening. (And that was if you survived the carbon monoxide poisoning from of all the stationery cars queued up and hardly moving for those 40 mins!) :-)
Just wanting to say I'm so excited to see wicked on Sunday night, I bought tickets the day they were available, it's my four year anniversary with my fiancee and has been on my bucket list for years....the building also looks amazing at night when it's lit up with green lights!!! 
Good work QPAC! you guys have some awesome staff manning those phone-lines! I was dreading a bit of a hassle in getting a refund ... but it was a snap - Now when I know whats happening down the track I can re-book my tickets :) THANK YOU ALL!
Went and saw Wicked last night and it was amazing! By far my favourite musical of all time. Still awaiting a call about a refund of my tickets for the 14th January, but as I understand the mammoth task you have in contacting people, I've bought a new set of tickets, and will patiently await the call to get a refund. Thanks!
I saw the show too tonight just awesome. thank you so much qpac cast members orchestra and all those involved in the production. just amazing.
I was just wondering when QPAC/QTIX will be releasing the remaining Wicked tickets for sale i.e. the rest of March and early April tickets. At the moment it doesn't seem you can buy these tickets through the qpac website. Thanks!  :)
Wow Wicked tonight was amazing, a stellar performance by the while cast. Lucy was so much perkier in Popular and Jemma sang one of the mist beautiful "I'm not that girl".  Full review on the Wicked Australia Brisbane Season Fan Page
H i was wondering if you could tell me on sunday the 13th of march you have a 1:30 and a 7:30 show offered however on another website they are offering a 3pm show for the same day can you please tell me which show times are correct so i can book my tickets? Thanks 
I loved yesterday's matinee show, the first one for Brisbane, we had FRONT ROW, CENTRE SEATS and didn't want the show to end... the cast where amazing, the show was amazing and I am going to go again... LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!! thank you so much to all of you for all of your hard work in making such a wonderful and entaining show... see you again soon...xx 
We loved WICKED the Musical - Australia! The cast, lighting and special effects were all AMAZING!!! It's on at QPAC til 6 March.
I managed to win the lotto yesterday matinee, it was my fifth time seeing the show and I LOVED IT :) It was great to see old and some new faces on the stage, the energy in the room was AMAZING. I'll definitely be trying my luck again! Thanks QPAC for hosting my fave musical ever and putting in all the effort to having them back up and running so soon after the devastating floods, :)
HI THERE SAW WICKED YESTERDAY AND IT WAS ABSOULTLEY AMAZING SPECTACULAR WANNA COME AND C IT AGAIN WHEN DOES THE SEASON END, ALSO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WERE AND POSITIONS OPENED AT THE MOMENT AND HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT APPLYING FOR THEM. THANKYOU QPAC
Hi QPAC just wanted to ask how the first show of Wicked went off today?  Can't say I"m not a little bit "Green" with envy as we were meant to see it last Tuesday...am so excited that you are finally up and running and am really looking forward to rescheduling my tickets..can't wait to see the show....well done QPAC and good luck for the rest of the season :)
Hi I have a question which u may or may not b able to answer..LOL...anyway I was on the Showbiz website n they have Wicked shows listed until the end of March but no prices avail. Has the season been extended but those dates been reserved solely for reschedules or will they b opened to the public? I really would luv to c it again n take my mum for her bday  Cheers :)
I have tickets for 9th Feb - next Wednesday - and we were trying to see if we could get an extra seat near us but on the QPAC website it doesn't even show our 7:30pm session any more only the 1:30pm.  Is our 7:30pm show still on??
Wicked was absolutley amazing yesterday, it was the perfect xmas present to my mum last year. Thankyou for bringing it to brisbane QPAC :)!!!
Hello! Firstly i hope all is well from the floods and that everyone and everything is safe :) My family had tickets for the 1-30 performance of wicked on the 15th of jan, we havent been contacted or notified and were just wondering what we do, or what is happening with these tickets if u could please help us with this or tell us where to contact for help it would be greatly appreciated thankyou xxx 
Hi, I have a pre-paid parking voucher for the show on saturday - I note that I must present it upon car park entry at the BCEC. Whereabouts are the entries that will be manned? All the entries to the BCEC parking I've used before aren't manned and just have the machine. Your help with this would be greatly appreciated! :)
Thanks to the QPAC staff for keeping this page so up to date, and for responding almost immediately to people's questions and requests for information.I have a group booking for Wicked on 22nd Jan, so have quite a few people to contact once I'm told whether the show will go ahead or not, but I understand the massive cleanup task ahead, and so will wait patiently until things get sorted.Keep up the great communication given the circumstances! :-)
My email account I used to book my tickets is not available to me now and I have changed my mobile number.  The tickets were posted out to me and I am still at that mailing address.  How will QPAC contact ticket holders?  I won't receive any email updates from my old email address.  (by the way - you are doing a great job)
YAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    :-D   Thank-you !
Hey There. Best wishes and a huge heartfelt thanks to the amazing work being done to pull the cultural heart of Brisbane back together after the deluge...  Quick question... ' my 8y/o daughters and I will be driving up form the Gold Coast and have tix for tuesday nights 'Wicked' (25/01) and was wondering about carpark options, as my voucher will probably be redundant due to the flood.. Can't call in, and have yet to receive responses to emails.. Any help/info would be appreciated Much love and thanks. K Spiros : )
HiI do know you are very busy cleaning up and trying to re-arrange shows. Just checking if there are any changes to Jesus Christ Superstar ? - got a group booking of 14 for Saturday 5/2/11.thanks :) 
Hi Guys,  I have a group of 45 booked for the 25th Matinee (and meet and greet) and a backstage tour for 10:30 that morning, we are coming from Maryborough and need to let the bus company know whether we are still coming and the time of departure.  I know you're flat out and doing your best but if there was a chance you could reply and let me know at least about the backstage tour that would be fantastic!
heyy guys,me and my family have tickets to the January 25th night session. Just wondering if it will be up and running so we can sort out our accomodation and transport. thanks :)
I am hoping that 'no new is good news'.  I live in Rockhampton and I have seats for Saturday evenings performance (2nd Balcony 3rd last row) not good seats but I will just be grateful to see the show! :-)  I have had my flights refunded as the airport here is still closed.  I have a car hired for tomorrow and I will be driving down with my mum and sisters.  I will be crushed if the show is cancelled, mainly because this was the only opportunity for me to see it.  I have accomodation booked, but whether there is a show or not...I am determined to just have a good time with my family. :-)  Thank you QPAC for all you are doing to get your building up and running!  (Fingers crossed though, huh!) :-D
I was told this morning that Thursday nights performance of wicked is highly unlikely and will more than likely be canceled...is this true? And do u Think you will have a definite answer before midday today? :) thanks for your efforts :) 
Hi, I had tickets of the 7:30 show on 15th. Could you possibly tell me when this will be rebooked? Thanks 
Hi there, not sure if you got this message this morning- apologies if you are reading this twice today:) We are over from NZ, having come for Wicked show, but are going home tomorrow. We can't afford to bring our kids back for another rescheduled show. Can we come to one of the performances tomorrow? Here's hoping. There are 5 of us. Thank you for all that you've done so far.
Hi QPAC, any news on Sat 22nd matinee yet...? I have a group booking of 40 tickets, and need to let some people know who are travelling from afar. I'm really hoping to get an answer in the next 10 minutes (eek...!) so I can call people today. Thanks in advance... :-)
Hey QPAC Can't wait to get back there to see Wicked for my 19th time!! You guys are doing an amazing job under these conditions! Brisbane do yourself a favour and see this great show if ou can, eat at all the resturants and lets help support to get the cultural presinct up running better than ever!!
HEY! we had tickets to see wicked on the 12/01 are we best just sitting back and waiting for you to contact us or should we try calling during the week? Good luck with all the clean ups, hope it is coming along as smooth as possible! :)
For all of those patrons who have unavoidably, yet completely understandably, had your Wicked shows postponed the wait will be worth it. I saw the show in Sydney and it is just amazing. Having regularly read this site over the last 2 weeks, I would like to say how impressed I have been with how you (the QPAC staff) have kept everyone informed during what have been very difficult circumstances. I certainly hope that the "green light" is given to open again tomorrow. I can't wait to be there on 6 March.
Your updates through this facebook site are fantastic - thank you!  I look forward to more updates tomorrow and wish all the staff their best wishes for the long stressful job ahead.  You guys are doing a great job!  :)
Hello! You've probably answered this question already, but I just want to make sure I have all the correct information. I had tickets for Friday 14th January and bought them through qtix. Do I have to call qtix or will they be calling me? I have another set of tickets for Wicked for Thursday 27th January, what is the chance of that performance going ahead? Hope the clean up is going well, and thanks for all the information! :)
Thanks QPAC for this great facebook page. You're all amazing! Looking forward to when you're up and running again - and let us know if you ever need a tribe of volunteers to come in.
While I am totally devastated that the Friday 21st performance of Wicked was cancelled and that we lost all the money we spent on airfares, I've already been looking at new tickets and flights. Hopefully I'll get to visit QPAC in February. :) 
We had booked tikets for Wicked on 22 Jan through Showbiz (qtix), & I have been following your updates.  Should we contact them about rescheduling our tickets? 
Hi, I here some of the CBD is still without power..  I hope this isn't affecting you..  It's hard to believe it's only been a week since the flood.. You are doing a great job of keeping us updated.. Thankyou.. :-D
Hi QPAC. What a fantastic job you are doing keeping everyone up to date with information. I can only imagine the clean up must be a hard and relentless job!! I have a quick question- my friend received an email yesterday saying what dates the cancelled shows have been rescheduled to, but I haven't received any further info regarding my cancelled show. Should I just be patient and wait till Monday? :)
SOUTH BRISBANE MELBOURNE ST 22 JAN 04:04 AM SOUTH BRISBANE GREY ST 19 JAN 10:01 PM Hey updater, I found these restoration times and dates from the energex website, hope these are some help to you guys :)
Would like to thank the wonderful Qtix staff for helping me reschedule.I waited on hold for over 80 minutes, but it was well worth it. Thanks also to whoever is running the QPAC Facebook page; you've been doing an exceptional job! Also, do you know when there will be any word on JCS?Best of luck for the re-opening of the Lyric tomorrow & the rest of the cleanup. :)
Well done QPAC team on the updates.  I received a message on my mobile today advising me that 23/1/11 show is postponed which I bought tickets for my in-laws for.  I did however also purchase 4 tickets for Saturday 22/1/11 for myself, my daughter and my parents which were not mentioned in the message.  I know that show has been postponed also - can I assume that you will contact me about rescheduling those tickets at a later date?  Sorry to be a pain - I really do appreciate the amount of communication that you guys have been providing!  :)
Will there be a lotto tomorrow? :)
hey qpac, you guys are doing an amazing job. Just wondering what time the box office opens tomorrow? Thanks in advance.
hello qpac, i was wondering if saturday the 22nd's performance is cancellled, or its still on? Thanks :)
hi i know our problem is insignificant compared to people caught in the floods - but  purchased tickets for my 13 year old daughter and 2 other family members for sun 16th - but she flies home on wed 26th and can only make the sat 22nd or sun 23rd -if you could assist it would b gr8ly appreciated ..please..please even if they have 2 sit separately :)
Hey QPAC, please keep Elphaba safe and dry I don't want her to melt ;)
I understand the difficulty for alot of people who have tickets to anything in QPAC at the moment, especially those who are traveling to Brisbane on holiday. However, QPAC is right on the Brisbane river and was badly hit by the floods and it is a very difficult task to get such a venue operational again. The staff who are probably working from either home or a temporary office have been nothing but supportful. They have answered the same questions countless amounts of times. PLEASE before asking your question, read the other posts on QPAC's wall and you'll find that your question has already been asked and answered. Resources in Brisbane are limited and for a business that is currently not functioning to make a profit, it is already a blessing that staff members have been answering all these questions over and over again using money, time and resources that could be better spent. I emplore you from my own accord to read and think before asking the excellent staff at QPAC questions they have already answered. I am some one who has missed a group booking for opening night, a weekend out with my partner to see WICKED and another performance that has been cancelled because of the floods and I have several other questions. However, I got most of them answered from reading comments to posts. All the information QPAC has, has already been released on the website and in older Facebook posts. Please go to those before asking your questions. The less time spent on Facebook, the more time spent getting QPAC operational again. Thank you :)
Hopefully everthing will be safe and dry by next wednesday. Wouldnt want all the props and costumes to be ruined or wet. We have a group of 23 coming to see the AMAZING Wicked next Wednesday. Fingers crossed! Our thoughts are with everyone at QPAC and involved with Wicked. Stay Safe. 
My tickets for last night were a Christmas present also but as long as staff, cast & crew are safe, high & dry - then that's the main thing! I'm impressed with the constant FB updates & quick replies.  In these circumstances, you guys have done a fantastic job at keeping us informed & up to date as possible.  Am looking forward to seeing Wicked when I can & if not - well, there are worse things......like losing homes & lives, both of which I am thankful I still have a firm hold of.  Thanks QPAC for all you are doing! <3
Hi, I have tickets to Wicked on Thursday 20th January & have been trying to phone you for the last 2 days but it's constantly engaged and qtix just goes to a voicemail service that's full...is the how still on? Mainly concerned as we have accommodation booked for that night and need to reschedule so we don't get charged for it :) 
i guess saturday will be out for wicked matinee???i have floaties :)
Hey QPAC... if you guys need any help cleaning up just let me know more then happy to help... And sorry to ask but do you know when you will have word on whether Wicked performances will commence on Monday or Tuesday? again Im happy to help you guys clean up :)
Hey QPAC - I just want to say what an amazing job you guys have been doing through this tough time - we had tickets to see Wicked on Tuesday 18th and have just found out its postponed.  Very disappointed as you can imagine as i have wanted to see the show for years...but hey i can only imagine how tough it has been on your guys trying to make these decisions!!!!!!   Hopefully the extra wait will just make it that much more special.   Good luck with getting everything up and running. Well done guys.
Thank you for all the brilliantly fast updates, I look forward to catching the show at a later date in March, saves me a rush trip in the next week along dreadful roads that have been damaged, hopefully Rocky airport will be open by that time so I dont have to drive =) Thankyou for all the speedy responses and good luck with the clean up, hope its not to stressful for you. =) K
hope everyone is safe there, best of luck to barricading the building :) x
well done QPAC for the amazing updates you have been providing. My sister and I had tickets to Tuesday's Wicked and we are so grateful for your quick and up to date info!
to who ever is posting these updates... ur a god to all of us here.. such great commitment to work... :-)
 Kaz Childs .. Can everyone pls copy and re post this message. It is from a friend of a friend of mine in QLD. She has available Yards Stables for people not knowing where to take their horses. She has enough rooms to take 15 to 20 horses. Located at Caboulture. Her phone number is 0418385774 ...if anyone needs emergenc...y accommodation for their horses..I HOPE U GUYS DONT MIND ME REPOSTING THIS IF U DO I CAN DELETE
Hi sorry but this is probably a question you have answered many times already but do you expect an answer today regrding closures for the rest of the week and if so roughly what time?  Hope allis going well with the clean up :)
Hey Qpac, amazing job hanging in there and keeping up the public updates - thank you!! Im from the Gold Coast and would be honoured to be able to help out physically with the clean up around South Bris and Qpac if I can. Unfortunately im working a lot next week but tomorrow Im free so I hope there will be some way I can come up and help. I know youre keeping people posted so ill keep looking out for updates. Thanks and keep soldiering on! Also hoping the cast of Wicked is safe and well. 
Hi QPAC.  We are scheduled to go to Wicked next Sat 22/1/11 at 1:30pm.  With the Rockhampton airport still expected to be closed we won't be able to make it.  Are we able to reschedule for February/March?  Thanks
Hey QPAC; i had tickets to the 19th of Jan's 'Wicked' and was wondering if the new shows will before they leave to go to a different state. You are doing an amazing job! thank you so much! 
am i still able to refund my ticket for the opening night show which was cancelled? Thanks for all your help! :)
Hey QPAC, thanks for being so awesome with letting people know what's happening with their shows.  I was wondering if Thursday's evening performance of Wicked is still going ahead.  I have to go to Warwick tomorrow with community recovery to help with the floods and will be gone until Saturday.  If the performance is going ahead, I need to find someone to take my ticket :-)
Just a kind reminder to anyone after info on the wicked shows/cancellations/changing tickets etc. Almost anything you could ever want to know has been answered several times in the below pages... so save Qpac a bit of time by scrolling down :) Im sure they have more than enough to keep them busy at the moment!
Any updates :) ?Glad to hear it's receding. Is all of southbank under? Is there even any power or access?
Hi there. I had tkts for todays performance at 1.30, spoke to lovely lady at QPAC but couldnt rebook as power out , so just enquiring can I rebook tkts on line and then get refund later?? Thankyou heaps and hope your efforts keep you dry. :-)
All fingers, toes and limbs crossed you get operational soon!!! I'm still keeping my hopes up! Lol 
Thank you to Ian and Qpac for changing my tickets to another day hassle free, thanks guys :)
Jesus Christ Superstar was utterly fantastic. I'm so excited to be going again on Saturday, this is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The cast are superb, the set is awesome & the atmosphere is amazing! This is a must-see for everyone, the cast should have got a standing ovation, because they completely deserved it.
Message for Beck .. Thank you for a great seat allocation , I could almost count the diamantes on Roby's  belt buckle ! Ewan and his band were , as usual excellent . Good choice to open the evening . Roby Lakatos and his Ensemble were excellent . would liked to have heard more Gypsy Music . From the moment of entering the complex the staff were just the best !!  Happy , helpful and they all looked as if they wanted to be there !!! Even managed to catch Alesa  at the Sunset on the Green She is well known in the Brisbane Music scene .Happy Christmas  to everyone :)) 
Just wanting to compliment QPAC on the wonderful lineup of shows that are going to be on for the rest of the year! I'm particularly looking foward to August- with Mamma Mia at the Lyric and Jesus Christ Superstar at the Playhouse, it's going to be great! :)Also just wondering, I know nothing has been officially announced, but what are the chances of Wicked making it's way up to Brisbane/QPAC? I saw it in Syndey and it is positively fantastic, it would be a shame if Brisbane audiences had to miss out!Keep the great shows coming! :D
Update on tomorrow's 1:30 wicked performance please!!!
Nice to read good stories that people got to speak to someone nice and got the same tickets they originally had or close too it.  I on the other hand spent alot of time and effort to get my original tickets, Balcony 1 front row to the 1:30 show tomorrow (now showing at the same time as the expected king tide).  Now Im 4 rows back with the "best available" seating and she was reluctant to change them.  I was flexible with any day or time but Im sure it was just to keep me in a 1:30 show as not to complicate things on the computer.  Sometimes you just can't win ! 
Just got back from the Christmas concert.  All I can say is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  It was beautiful.  Best Christmas concert I've been too.  The singers were great, the choir and orchestra fantastic and the junior singers amazing.  Good on you QPAC, can't wait for next christmas.
Volunteers Needed - The Gothic Symphony Brisbane 2010 Come and be part of this event :-)
QPAC is awesome!!!!!! i had my group booking rescheduled to another date and everybody is happy. linda in the group booking department is my new favourite person :D
I would like to thank the amazing people at QPAC and QTIX! The amazing lady I spoke to managed to change my tickets to a date in March and in the same row. I was beyond ecstatic!
As advised we arrived for the 2:30pm show today - paid for parking, walked 15 mins in the rain, child in tow - only to discover once they'd assessed the number of people arriving they decided to cancel the show. At no time did they notify the cancellation on Facebook (i had continued to check it until the moment we entered the carpark). They refunded or rebooked tickets and were very pleasant, however clearly it's very frustrating. Think they should have continued with the performance, or posted the cancellation on Facebook however late. 
Thank you so much for your updates today.  I hope that you all get home safely from southbank and that we all stay safe.  :)
I'm going to be watching this page a lot more closely now... and I'll be seeing you next Saturday for Warriors of Brazil =)
The changeover looks amazing on your website, excellent job!!!
To say that the show must go on is one thing. But don't you think giving the extensive flooding around Brisbane CBD and your current carpark situation, you should re think and cancel the performance? To have that many people so close to the Brisbane River or let alone travelling through terrible road conditions just to get to the performance is worrying. Just cancel already! Just because you aren't flooded doesn't mean the rest of Brisbane isn't!
West Side Story was great, the performance of Officer Krupke was comedy gold :) <3
Loved Chicago :)
I am starting work experience tomorrow at QPAC :D Can't wait!

Best night at surfers dressed like a hobo!! Drank to much at Irish pub, stayed at strip club till 5am, kissed a chick, met my future husband, attempted pole dancing, failed.. Slept in my car (for an hour) then drove back to Brisbane... Night complete <3

Forget what your mamma said about slurping your soup! Welcome to Single Origin Cupping! The world of cupping is an essential way to gauge and observe the tastes + flavors of brewed coffee.

One of the cheapest cinemas in London, with amazing rates if you're a member and cult film-a-thons. Love the kitsch red leather seats.
Try the cashew nut chicken. It's amazing
With only one exit open, when you get to the barriers, head to the far right - it's much quicker than all the slowies on the left... Also - the Argyll St exit (on right) has free cashpoints nearby :)
Parmesan shortbread is pretty amazing
Whatever you pick on the breakfast menu is guaranteed to be amazing. That goes for the coffee too.
The most amazing meal I've had in Sydney for a long time! We came here for our anniversary dinner. Lx

One of the good backpackers with reasonable price. Clean n modern toilets with cosy common areas :D huge tv too

People watching with lots of couches :)

Get the man to make the sandwich :) and ask for the homemade mayo <3
Want some amazing Asian food? Go to Paddy's Market, top floor - an absolutely satisfying selection of Thai, Chinese, Korean or Japanese food!
A *must do* - beautiful walk, amazing views of CBD, Opera House and Harbour Bridge! (Also great spot for a run)

MI PRIMER DOMINGO DE PASEO POR SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA NADA MAL HE HAY K APROBECHAR MI DIA LIBRE :)

Amazing selection, any color you like!
Bikes not allowed until after 6:30p or else you'll get called out over the PA system (as witnessed).

Amazing pork belly taco & chorizo quesadillas w/ mayo (I'm certain is the same one used in the mini b√°nh m√¨ at Ms.G's). Churros w/ dulce de leche = heaven. Pink cuco is essential. Epic cheesy hotdog.
Lines are usually long but they serve their tonkotsu ramen at 2:00-3:30ish and only 15 bowls are made per day. Pretty good value for under $12. Top level of The Galleries Victoria. Next to Kinokuniya.

Great view of Union Square from the terrace. :)
The pleasure of open art galleries  :-)
Fun music in the bar on a Thurs might :)
Amazing pork sliders & chicken liver parfait had me swooning! Creamy pate along with the crunch of the tortilla & the crispness of the chicken wing is a bomb explosion. Ice cream sandwich is awesome.

Be sure to get a Fast Track Pass to skip the lines for the best slides! :)

Newtown hotel :)
This is a couple of weeks overdue but better late than never, right?In mid-December 2012, I organised a Superhero Pub Crawl for my partner and one of our best friends as a joint birthday celebration, which took place on the Newtown main drag.Arriving at Newtown Hotel around 9pm in a largish group (most in Superhero costume), I, based on past experiences from many nights out in Sydney, expected to be vetted individually at the door and basically given a bit of a hard time being in a large group and I guess, sticking out more than usual in costume.   Instead, we were ALL more than pleasantly greeted by, (lack of a better word), the Ma√Ætre d' /Master of the Establishment at the door; Alex.  With such a welcoming manner and friendly banter on arrival, Alex made us all feel instantly welcome and at ease to continue the birthday celebrations at this pub crawl stop.Not only did Alex make us all feel welcome, he even helped by putting away our bag of presents and camera bag that we were lugging around whilst we were there.Most of our group were regular patrons of Newtown Hotel before it's refurbishment, and on our first proper outing there since the refurb', I'm ecstatic to see that Key Stone has retained the alternative spirit of Newtown at this establishment.Alex, this town needs more people like you!  Your hospitality will never be forgotten and we look forward to many, many more good times at Newtown Hotel :)Our Kindest Regards & Best Wishes for 2013,Catwoman & Batman Xo.

So much hype about the place. Well done on generating all the interest. We've noted a packed pub on a few walk-bys and a quick drink. We look forward to visiting (and reviewing) soon ;)

An Open Letter of Thanks to the Good Patrons and Staff of the Newtown Hotel on Saturday 4 May and Sunday 5 May 2013: Restoring Faith in Humanity - one step at a time...Between the shock discovery shortly before midnight on one completely unexpectedly inebriated pub crawl and dinner around the friendly, fond, familiar and favourite streets of Newtown and surrounds (The Place Beyond the Pines was sold out at Dendy at 3, so it was a logical progression and conclusion to the evening - especially given the fortuitous coincidence and unexpected attendance of some other friends we happened upon at another new/old bar recently reopened in Newtown) to the sombre light of reality the next morning - turning instead to a more wistful contemplation not unlike the scene in Happy-go-lucky (thank you a certain someone - you know who you are - for sharing that moment with me that I might have it with me at a time like this) where the lead actress reflects contemplatively but largely unconcerned by the theft of her much adored bicycle - it has been a tumultuous 24 hours‚Ä¶ well, perhaps it has been a tumultuous 24 days ‚Ä¶ or weeks, or months, or years - depending on your perspective I suppose.Purchased second hand like so many things of mine, but no less loved for the fact, my beloved capturer of so many joyous and wondrous moments in the last couple of years of my life (some my own, some shared, some belonging to others; many of which are all I have left of things ever so dear to me that my words and phraseology are ill-equipped to convey despite my occasional attempts) and equally, my sturdy workhorse of late: my Canon SLR + newly purchased pre-loved lens to accompany it sadly went missing.   It's not the latest model any more, but I'm sure in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing with it, it would still take some pretty good shots (occasionally, and given the opportunity to take enough of them myself, even I've managed to fluke one or two that are half decent :).   Likewise, it warrants mention that someone could still have fetched a pretty penny for it on the market and sadly I could hardly justify the significant cost of replacement; I could have lost it in any one of half a dozen places, and all were helpful in my endeavours to recover it.I tried to console myself with thoughts that perhaps now it's in better and more capable hands than my own, or that it may change someone else's life for the better - as it certainly has mine - or that someone may use it to learn about photography, people and even the world and make it a better place for it's use; and all the while to try not to be too dismayed that that same person may have been the cause that I should have it no more.   Though I did okay to distract myself, it's hard to remain consistently positive about such things, even though charity is close to my heart - it meant so much to me, and has enabled me to look back so fondly over the many beautiful memories it's accidentally taken with my finger on the trigger or remote - not always well framed, tastefully developed with appropriate lighting and all that jazz, but meaningful to me (and hopefully others too) nonetheless.And so, after trying to locate it without success, I do what I always do, what so many of us do: I endeavoured to distract myself, prolong the inevitable pangs of what's that thing called - oh yes, sadness.   While enjoying a terrible game of golf nearby - something to which my friends will no doubt attest that I do very poorly at that, though rarely - I was astounded by a faith-in-humanity-restoring phone call from a one of many lovely people in a long chain who could have easily profited from my misfortune but did not (someone who I'm yet to have the privilege of thanking in person).And so, until I have the opportunity to do so more formerly, Michelle, Kendall, the person(s) who came upon it, and everyone else who was so kind to a stranger, for no better reason than that you could be, from the bottom of my little heart, thank you.   The only thing I'm slightly disappointed about is that there aren't any photos of it's night of adventure in Newtown without me of the new and unknown friends that found it - perhaps you'll indulge me next time we're all out!   ‚Äì Thank You ‚ÄìI end with a quote from a song, maybe because I'm being even more sentimental than usual.   It's about a flying tonight, and it goes: "over the friends that we've known, and those that we now know, and those who we've yet to meet."If it wouldn't detract from the people I'm trying specifically to thank, I would and possibly should even extend my thanks to the good people of Newtown, Sydney and even mankind while I'm at it - certainly to those who believe in good citizenship - be it as individuals, groups and organisations, companies, and even corporations.   Over the years I've had the pleasure of working with or otherwise come to know some kind-hearted magnificent souls - occasionally in charity, and recently through CSR, but every day, in everything we do, there are countless examples and many good-hearted people we encounter if we let ourselves.   (By the by, as for corporations, they're not all as evil as you may think - some really good people I care for, admire and even love work for them too, and some give back - what little voice I have in helping that happen, I exercise frequently).   I invariably digress - I'm clearly suffering sunstroke; suffice to say there are a lot of people doing thankless things, quite a lot of unlikely heroes walking amongst us, and, we must try to assume the best in people on first glance regardless of our own predispositions, statistical probabilities, and appearances - even to the better people amongst us, this isn't always easy and can be difficult to apply universally.On that note, another almost-dear-friend (I only say 'almost' because I don't them that well, much though I think highly of them) recently recounted a story to me about a home-invasion in a neighbouring suburb by someone high on a cocktail of drugs.   Perhaps this is a story for the next episode, but I was so impressed and inspired by the way in which the situation was handled and diffused by one of the would-be victims to such unexpected and positive effect (much though I pride myself on being calm during crises, I can't say I'd have been as level-headed, selfless and reasonable when confronted with something this).   Most of us are so very lucky in this day and age; there's no excuse for cruelty and every reason to be kind.Have a lovely night and week everyone.   Thank you simply for being part of a place that's good to call home.Arpad Simone(as I always say though, friends call me "Arki"; and if you're happy to consider me a friend - albeit one you may not yet know - then you're more than welcome to call me Arki too :)

We're DJing this Saturday at Newtown Hotel. Yew! Straya Day <3
Thundafam in Sydney, DJ Morgs is busting out a massive DJ set with Van She + Midnight Juggernauts @ The Newtown Hotel tomorrow night! To celebrate we dug up this set he did on triple j back in October. Surely will get you in the mood for the long weekend!

Pre-long weekend celebrating! ;)
can you please explain your split pea dip and pita bread?? everyone was confused by it. we were given a huge bowl of dip, and literally one pita bread cut into quarters. it was not even enough bread for one person to try and load with dip. shared between two we loaded each slice to the edges about half a centimetre  thick and only got through half the dip.it seems to be a blatantly deliberately disproportionate serving tactic, you order something you've paid for and expect to get, and then have to fork out another $2.50 for more measly bread just to finish your meal properly. when we asked the waitress for more bread she told us that previous patrons have actually refused and walked out..so it's obviously bothered others already. you should really sort it out, it seems like such a stupid petty issue, overcharging for insufficient bread, to give the place a stingey reputation. i hardly ever post about venues but this was so annoying, it isn't fun being ripped off, and i'll probly tell people about it, instead of how awesome the decor was. thought you should know. otherwise it tasted amazing.
So, my gorgeous, very well experienced but rather critical pub going mates have just declared the Newtown Hotel at the best pub in OZ. Well done people. Can't wait to get there and check it out myself. Sydney trip here I come. :-)
TONIGHT! Turbo Trivia at The Newtown Hotel with Felicity Frockaccino from 7:30pm! FREE to play with over $150 of prizes to win! Also $1000 Pick the Joker! See you each and every Monday at The Newtown!

It all seems so amazing and artistic until you realise you are staring at a dead animal. Taxidermy is not an art form, as it is now being labeled, it's a sick way for humans to assure themselves they are still the top of the food chain!

Braved the cold and terrential rain this morning for our 2 hour training session at Bondi Beach! 2 brave girls we are with @yumchacha :) felt the best to have a hot shower and slip into bed with a hot tea after what felt like hypothermia. Punched through our strength session like champions followed by a Bondi to Bronte run and back!

The Edge is such a hidden treasure...mostly CBD youth...imagine if these opportunities were spread out to "multicultural youth" too?That is what you call "cool"...check out the space and may be even become a mentor if you are with the edge and you are nearly a pro at www.m-yes.org you can be a mentor. Why wait..share the love.
My car got a flat tyre in the car park earlier this evening... Not only did 4 incredible security staff come to my rescue with help and bottles of water, but strangers stopped to help! One was an amazing gentleman with a trolley full of groceries and 2 young children and many others stopped to help him. What a kind community at Westfield Bondi Junction am full of gratitude for help from your amazing staff and even more amazing shoppers!!

I just want to commend the Westfield Carousel staff for such a well planned event today. I had a fab view because I got there early but the overall organisation was top notch and that makes all the difference. Loved the idea of the professional photos being taken. I simply cannot wait until they are posted! Harrison was absolutely wonderful. Epic day overall. I hope the photos get put up soon! Can't wait! <3

Met this crazy aussie girl named Stacey about 7 months ago while doing the Lost City trek in Colombia.  We had so much fun on such an intense trek but the best thing is, you know when you're travelling and you meet all these amazing people and after that you dont know if you'll ever see them again? Well stacey just moved to sydney so I'll be seeing her pretty face quite a lot yaaaay!! :D
Artistic :D

'I met an amazing choreographer at Yaddo -- an 80 year old woman; Sally Gross. From NY. She told me that I was young. That there was enough time in my life for everything; being alone, being with women, with difficult men, with not-difficult men. This was soothing. There's enough time in my life for everything.'(Email from Sheila Heti via Miranda July.)

Happy George Smith Day Errrbody:):):) Dear wallaby mid field please leave your busted convoluted trick plays at home and just feed Folau quick early ball so he can get his Ricky Bobby on and shake & bake fools and create space for those following him. P.S get ready to D up in the 10-12 channel you're gonna be busy!
A PLEA -  Wallabies supporters who are fortunate enough to be attending the game at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - you've gotta scream and shout constantly for our boys in Gold - somebody must be able to come up with an easy chant for us - we hate hearing that droning "LIONS" chant and need to hear only vocal support for our team.  Thank you from all Wallabies supporters who can't be there physically to lend their voices but who are still 100% behind our Wallabies for a win :)  
G'day from down under!My brother has been nominated to win the SBL (West Australian, State Basketball League) newcomer of the month! He's 19 years old and has been working really hard at basketball ever since he was old enough to walk!  This is his first season in the league and he hasn't even been to college in the U.S.A. (yet - he would like to)His rival has been to junior college and has already been playing in this league for 3 years!  This season he has averaged 12.2 ptsand 3.9 rebounds a game.We've decided to let you decide who deserves it more as one ofhis rivals has posted it in an Aussie News website and we think that was a bit dodgy.  So we need your help to even up the score- well hopefully WIN!!!This season my brother, Joshua Throns, has averaged 16.5 pts and 6 rebounds a game.Please feel free to watch his highlight reel, which his made to send to coaches as he hopes to be accepted into a college next year!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOb83ABVENgPlease follow this link and click the dot beside Joshua Throns,https://www.facebook.com/questions/610356415649815/?refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flogin.php&refid=9&_rdr&_=_

Hey Mr Robbie Deans and co-selectors : The Melbourne Rebels boys proved tonight that Rob Horne, Wycliff Palu, Sekope Kepu and Dave Dennis are NOT the best players and instead of them, you should have selected : Kyle Godwin , Scott Brown, Laurie Weeks and Ben McCalman as well as Hugh Pyle. :-) 
REMEMBER THIS xDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4uGwJAisAg
Has anyone seen this? This is gonna be amazing!!Just before last test match
Wish the selectors would have picked on Form , and gone for :  Quade Cooper and Matt Toomua over JOC , leave out Rob Horne & selected Western Force # 12 with Leailifano ...and Hugh Pyle over Wycliff Palu with Higginbottham and QLD Captain James at # 8  ;-)  Also , Mogg should been in !!  ;-)

My thoughts for all those wanting to "Be Bold, Wear Gold" for the Lions series... Just my humble opinion mind you!Looking forward to the ARU's response :)Hello,I would like to comment on merchandising pricing.I understand that the licenced provider of supporter gear sets prices for jerseys, etc in order to help the reutrn on their investment in the sport. However, I am greatly dismayed to see the prices for Lion's supporters gear is much cheaper than that for the Wallabies. For example, their jersey has been selling for around $120 compared with $150-180 for Wallaby jumpers.This is disappointing because it would seem to discourage home team support for a much publicised event, especially given the ARU's request that people counter the colourful and vocal touring team's supporters.These supporters are already at a currency advantage, which also makes their purchases even more affordable for them.This situation is a disservice to the Wallabies, the supporters and the game in general, especially when the ARU is trying to rebuild the popularity and fan base.Is there any reason why Wallabies fans are placed at such a disadvantage? Could there be opportunities for package deals (tickets plus jerseys or family packs) to make this considerable outlay for most people more affordable?I look forward to your reply.Regards,Anthony

The ARU has the right to deny admission if the licence has terminated.

The Grand Slam is a huge challenge like no other and unique to our team, over 1200 km, 12 days in 6 locations and each rider must raise $15k to be eligible to complete the Ride to Conquer Cancer rides which will likely raise over $30m this year in Australia alone for cancer research! We will be joined by thousands of other riders.

Dear Wallabies, I am writing to you in regard to our appeal that my girlfriend & I have set up just 12 days ago to help the people affected by the bush fires here in Tasmania. We truly are a 2 person outfit except for the help of some very kind people to deliver some of our goods. In the short time we have been operating we have raised, collected & delivered over $110k in new & used goods. We deliver to Hobart, Bicheno & as of yesterday Dunalley where we had boats leaving Primrose Sands sailing to Dunalley before the roads were reopened. Every item is delivered within a day of collection. We have set up a Facebook page 11 days ago called "Launceston Bush Fire Appeal", we have had over 400 likes, we have reached over 18k people & we have gone viral already. We have had a number of radio interviews, newspaper articles & yesterday we had our first television news interview to announce what we are doing. Then more media is being arranged for our presentation to the principal, teachers & students of the school later this week of all our goods. We also are making up care bags fir each of the 130 students of the primary school made up of toys, games, lollies, school supplies, stickers & the like to give the kids an extra lift. We have received so much support from the public, small businesses,  larger businesses & larger corporations are coming aboard to help us as our reputation for making a huge difference to so many people spreads. We also have a side project, helping to supply all types of educational items, toys, books, tv's, computers & the like to the school at Dunalley. We have received $10k worth of books from a local book store, also a mass of kids dvd's, cd's, food, toilet paper, furniture & games to the total of about $20k so far. We now are looking for sports equipment & that's where we hope your team could help us with a donation of some grass roots rugby gear & the like please? Also any merchandise you could donate to decorate the school or to put in our care bags would be fantastic, we were thinking along the lines of a signed shirt, ball or any other products your team could provide please? We are 110% committed to what we are doing & fully prepared to see this through to the end.

These are the last moments of a bull named 'Madness'.

Can you tell your media team to stop posting media releases and stories on rugby.com.au, with a minute-by-minute recap of every knock on, scrum and penalty during each test?! I'm not surprised the Australian media are so negative in how they cover the sport, when the whole focus of your content is on stoppages and penalties. Do yourselves a favour and focus on what makes rugby amazing, the crowds, the colour, the singing - NOT this minute-by-minute crap.

IF YOU WANT A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL I CAN SEND ONE THROUGH VIA EMAIL. ### LETS CREATE A REVOLUTION OF OUR OWN. THE RUGBY SPRING! ###SAVING THE RUNNING GAME IN 5 SIMPLE STEPSAN OPEN LETTER TO THE IRBDear International Rugby Board,Watching Rugby is like watching my Grandmother trying to get out of a chair.Our game is boring, awkward, and frankly, a touch embarrassing. This Saturday night gone, I was on my couch watching the World Champion All Blacks, and the number two-ranked side in the world, The Wallabies, battle out a tight but spectacularly dull Bledisloe Cup match. Whilst watching this stop-start-stop affair I reluctantly came to terms with the fact that I would rather be watching Youtube, going to the cinema, or the pub, or worse still for you, watching a replay of last week‚Äôs entertaining Rugby League game between New Zealand and Australia. I mean an 18 all draw with fifteen shots at goal, NO TRIES, almost no line breaks, between the two best and most attacking minded sides on the planet!!!! Give me a break. In the 80th minute, All Black‚Äôs Captain, Richie McCall, decided to go all-out and ran the ball, and I finally felt the joy of watching running Rugby again. It was beautiful. Sublime. Tense. Thrilling‚Ä¶But it lasted for 1 minute. After the clock had run down. Sadly, the defining moment of this game was the final push for points by the desperate Wallabies. In the final minute of the game, trundling towards the All Black‚Äôs line and with nothing to lose, the Australians decided to put the game into the referee‚Äôs hands and adopt the negative tactic of playing for a penalty. I am a Wallabies Die Hard but I couldn‚Äôt be happier this play was not rewarded. So what? ‚Ä¶ Well, it happens in sport and two evenly matched sides can often nullify each other‚Äôs enterprising play, turning the game into an arm wrestle. But the problem for Rugby is that this sort of negative play has been common practice this year. The penalty goal has been relied upon far too often as a means of winning. Players and coaches cannot be blamed, they need to win or they lose their jobs. Referees cannot bare the brunt of the blame either, they are simply implementing the rules the best way they know how in real time, spontaneously as they see it. So what is at the heart of this cynicism? Simple. The laws of the game. Now what we are seeing is a paradox has been created, because in order to win an insidious mindset has been born within teams from the afterbirth of these ill-conceived laws. It is the way teams need to exploit these flawed laws in order to win that creates a cynical attitude and this attitude is manifesting in the form of boring, stop-start-stop play.Spectators can sense this attitude and even if they can‚Äôt put a finger on it they can feel it. The result is that fans are turning their back on the game.You see, the thing is, if I was just some part-time viewer, some layman, out for a bit of casual sports entertainment, and I switched channels it would only be of minor concern to you. Sure you‚Äôve lost another television viewer but perhaps next years‚Äô marketing campaign could turn things around. But if you lose me and my support, well, this is something far more serious. In fact, you could say it would be drastic and dire, because I am someone who has played Rugby since I was four years old. I am a fanatic. I was a kid who used to make my dad buy me the latest Rugby magazines every week. Who went to a private school and played in the First Fifteen. Who battled it out in front of miniscule crowds on a Saturday afternoon for my club. Who paid precious pennies for Foxtel on a minimum wage. Who staunchly stood strong in the face of constant barrage, banter, and ear-bashing from other code‚Äôs one eyed supporters.Put simply, I am your core audience. I am the one you seem so complacent about retaining. But time to wake up IRB. I am not the exception. Fans are leaving in droves. I am one of the last people I know to finally loosen my grip and relinquish my fight to defend the game I love. However‚Ä¶All is not lost if you act fast. I have the solution. Five basic changes to the laws, which will revolutionise the game, and put it back in its rightful place as one of the premier sports in the world‚Ä¶And they are so simple. 1) PENALTIES: All long arm penalties between the areas marked by both 22 lines will be replaced with short arm penalties.Reason for Law change #1- Will speed up the game, encourage running, attacking, Rugby. Will put an end to the negative tactic of playing for the whistle and long-range penalty kicks. 2) SHORT ARM PENALTIES: When a short arm penalty is awarded, the referee will promptly march the attacking team 10 metres forward and award the Short arm penalty on the mark here. The defending team will have to retire 10 more metres behind the mark (ie 20 metres from where the infringement occurred). Reason for Law change #2- Will dramatically benefit the attacking team and open up the game, encouraging an attacking brand of Rugby. It will put offending sides on the back foot and it will create a super pace and flow to the game. This is where the game would traditionally be stopped for a long arm penalty. 3) PENALTIES #2: (1) Within the 22, if the defending side infringes the play for a penalty, then a long Arm penalty will be awarded and the offending player will be sin binned for 10 minutes immediately. No warnings. (2) If the attacking team infringes for a penalty while in the 22, a short arm penalty will be awarded to the defending team. Reason for Law change #3- This will work because the defending team will not want to infringe due to the harsh consequences. Therefore there should be far less infringements, promoting continuity and attack from the offensive side and fair play from the defending side. Also, if a player infringes, this will be considered negative play. The player will be sin binned for 10 minutes, causing more open space on the field. More open space promotes attacking Rugby and more tries. More tries means more thrills. More thrills means more bums on seats. Simple.4) KICKING FOR TOUCH IN THE 22: NO GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARDS. If the ball is kicked out in the 22 the same rules apply as with within the rest of the field. Line out - inline with where the ball was kicked. Reason for Law change #4- Instead of a defending team being able to simply nullify enterprising attack from the opposition with one kick, the defending team will now have to work for it. This will mean the pressure will be immense on the defending team and they will have to either be diligent to get out of trouble or employ enterprising counter attack, which will be exhilarating. The attacking team will benefit from this law and there will be far more tension every time the ball is in the ‚ÄúRed Zone‚Äù, (22 area). Continuity will be promoted by keeping the ball in play. 5) SCRUMS: (1) In the areas between both 5 metre lines; Only one reset allowed. When a scrum collapses the referee must nominate whom he believes to be the offending player and issue a verbal warning. On the second collapse the referee must adjudicate who was the offending player for the second incident and award a SHORT ARM PENALTY to the opposing side. The option to reset a scrum for a third time will not be allowed. (2) 5 METRE SCRUM; Due to the spectacular tension and excitement that can be generated by a 5 metre push-over try, this law will not apply to a 5 metre scrum. Reason for Law Change #5- Scrum resets are killing the continuity of the game and boring crowds senseless. This law will reverse the trend and get the game started quickly.Also, because the referee must nominate the offending player this keeps the referee accountable and less likely to make arbitrary decisions. WHY THESE SIMPLE CHANGES WILL WORKRugby is an intricate game developed and built upon over generations. The Ruck laws in particular are extremely complicated. Defences have improved in the professional era. Players have become bigger and faster with the introduction of advanced training methods but the field has remained the same size. Space on the pitch has become too limited. Also, Unfortunately, International Referees in Rugby all appear to have oral fixations and seem to enjoy blowing the whistle way too much. I‚Äôm sure referees are not intentionally stalling the game but this is the reality. The combination of these factors is deadly and killing the game. These new laws will compensate for this by making an infringement speed the game up!!! Short arm penalties will dynamically transition play from static play to attack, like a booster charge, instead of stopping the game. Once implemented the new laws will also create more spaces in defences for attacking teams to exploit because defenders will be scrambling to retreat 20 metres once the whistle has blown. It‚Äôs genius really. Now the crowds, will be happy with even your most whistle happy ref because the harder he blows the pea the faster the game will become. Most games will resemble something along the lines of the Sydney Bledisloe Cup, 2000, dubbed ‚ÄúThe Game That Came Down From Heaven‚Äù. The spectacular brand of Rugby displayed in this famous match would become the norm and not the exception. The laws will influence positive mindsets in all facets of the game and promote fair play. The crowds will be entertained, and lets face it, this is the purpose of professional sport, to entertain the people. A point the IRB would do well to remember.With the implementation of these simple Laws the balance of the game will be restored. Attacking Rugby will be prompted and more tries will be scored and the crowds will flock through the gates because there will be a running bonanza. The result should be that 15 a side Rugby will be one of the fastest and most furious games on the planet. There will be almost no stoppages.Exciting players, whom crowds flock to see, the players with attacking brilliance like Quade Cooper, etc. will really benefit from the law changes because the new format will break the game open. Backlines will be utilised again. Excitement and thrills will be returned to Rugby.The beauty is there is no dramatic structural change to the game necessary. These laws are so easy to implement and will work.Personal address to the members of the IRB; If you do not respond and implement these changes then I propose you are out of touch and should abdicate immediately. Move aside for someone else willing to adapt to a crowded market. Generations X and Y are waiting in the wings to fix the mess you have created.IRB - Our game, the Running Game, more than ever, needs you. Kind Regards,Rugby lover. Fanatic. Disheartened Fan,

Take a look through my posts/timeline and you will see that I was there.  Please fix it up before the next game.

We're all giving David Pocock for being outstanding this world cup, but we also gotta give credit to Adam Ashley Cooper, dude played amazing, every minute of the world cup. Absolutely amazing!
Being witness to that stadium erupt last night was a very very special moment- even more so given all that NZ has been through recently. What a moment and what a team. Well done all of you for giving the world a precious memory:)

Just wanted to say CONGRATULATION FOR THE BRONZE MEDAL!! And all the best for you, your knee & your rugby career. Oh & you have gorgous eyes. And i dont thnnk your a traitor at all. You moved to Aussie when you were 13, thats like 10 yrs ago ( And yes i did my researce lol) :L ALL the BEST from an ALLBLACK FAN (& now a little bit of a Wallabies too)P.S Qantas Wallabies get ths message across to Quade Copper somehow. <3 you QC

Heey WallabiesEven though i am a kiwi and a All Blacks Supporter i would like to Congratulate you guys on Get so far in the Tournament and good luck for the game tomorrow , It was a Close Game against the AB's both teams Deserved to go to the Finals...... Even though i hate Quade Cooper for what he did to Richie McCaw i still think you look better in a black jersey you should come back to your home New Zealand and play for the All Blacks (never mind your decision)Good luck All Blacks Supporter XD
Fellow Anzacs...... I think we're squabbling over something that is blanketed in a tad of confusion. Perhaps by clarifying, maybe we can steer ourselves back to the point of origin which is celebrating the wonderful world cup. There has been a pocket of NZ supporters who have behaved in a pretty poorly manner Re certain aspects of the world cup. New Zealand as a nation however, has (throughout the whole of the world cup campaign) banded together with heart and soul to  treat us with a great deal of respect (just ask Kearnsi and rest of the commentary boys for example). When looking at any situation one needs to take in to account that 'perspective' can sometimes be very lop sided, and individuals need to be mindful of balancing that before judging. NZ have done an amazing job of hosting the world cup just post one of the biggest natural disasters in their history. What an effort to have pulled together as a country in this time of crisis and to have provided STILL -a great event. To the small pocket of (probably drunk) silly buggers who were behaving badly...... You should be ashamed. To the large majority of the Nz population - well done and thank you- as a fellow Anzac I'm incredibly proud of what you achieved here in this world cup:)
Ngaaaw , better luck nexts year if everyone makes it through 2012 but New Zealand all the way .... Tough competition though guys :)
From a kiwi, I'd just like to say well done to the Wallabies. You guys will forever be our best competitors, no matter the conditions - win or lose. It's always an exciting game when both are on the field. Sometimes a team is only as great as the team it plays, so thank you. :)
im an all black heart, mind, and soul!!! but been living in this beautiful country australia for 20 years...it use to feel good beating the ozzies... just don't feel that good anymore!!! anyways well done to the wallabies, you all played good!!! thanks for giving me such great entertainment with my family!!! you guys will smash wales...you still have a whole country backing you...get em hard:)
no matter what quade copper is still best player for the wallabies,without him australia wouldnt get up to the semi-final.it's not the end of the world,GO COPPER GO KEEP SMILEING NO MATTER WHAT :)
I am a ab's supporter and I went to the game. I give credit to the wallabies for their amazing endurance to keep fighting. Q.Cooper played not to bad considering the massive crowd against him.
As an All Blacks supporter i wanna say thanks to the Wallabies for helping showcase the best match of the world cup, great game and sportsmanship. Unfortunately some of my countrymen take it too far with the sledging, so i encourage them its  good to be humble in victory. NZ like Aus has been through some crap the last couple of years with the earthquake/mines and now the Rena oil spill and you guys with the floods, so for 80 minutes it was good to escape and watch a good test match. All the best for the Wales match on friday, im a Wallabie supporter for that day lol looking forwarded to seeing Ioane tear it up on the wing, Wallabies by 20 is my pick !  
You made such a good effort guys, so proud we made it to the semi's! And Quade doesn't need to learn any respect, because you can't learn something you already know. Maybe the All Blacks should take a long, hard look at their own team and fan's attitudes. :)
Well done Wallabies. That was one hard fought game and one as a kiwi I was dreading. I am glad we won, you guys have had the cup twice, our turn to have a go at getting it. Good luck for Fridays game :)
STANDINBLACK <3Your comment to the All Blacks group, shows a lot of sportsmanship !! Your comment made me somehow like the wallabies <3 haha Goodluck for the bronze finals !!

 Even though the Wallabies lost to the All Blacks i still support you 200%. Watching the game last night and seeing how my poor David Pocock (amazing player) fight for the ball i felt sorry for him. He looked like he wanted to win the game but I guess the All Blacks felt confident cause it was their field and their homegame. Overall good job to every Wallabian especially my David Pocock, Genia (you did awesome) James Oconnor (very talented youngster) Quade Cooper (what can i say? you are a true rugby player and to those who  doesn't like how you play will just have to shut up and keep it to themselves. You make mistakes but so what?      Every good player does that. And lastly good job to the Skipper James Horwil and not forgetting the Coach Robbie Deans. YOU MAKE A SAMOAN CITIZEN PROUD even though i have no connections to your country lol and i have never been to your country lol but im still a hard core............Samoan Wallabies FanMel Vavae
At the start of the RWC Quade Cooper asked what was a "must see" in Auckland. Well he gets his must see opportunity this weekend when Ritchie McCaw lifts Web Ellis lol
GO THE WALLABIES!!!! you are still number #1 in our hearts and number #1 in the field!!!! *sings* waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda...... :)
I'm an All Blacks supporter. But I feel sorry for Aussie though, must be hard to play when your getting booed and everyone's cheering for the other team. You will definitely come third hands down... All Blacks did it wooo hooo :))
Whats the difference between thewallabies and a teabag??....A teabag stays in the cup longer, lolgo ALL BLACKZ 'Yeah buddy'
Dear Wallabies Rugby team, in order for you to get back into your country undetected, it may be better to swim :) happy travels home :)

Message from GOD for all people watching it Sunday morning UK time," I will be late for church,bit busy for 80 minutes, just hold your prayer requests till after the game,oh and congratulations Wallabies,:)) "
The law of FOCUS. Watched your Tri nations Game first half brilliant.When you just DO IT play your natural instinctive game and not think about it your talents are amazing. Digby just never says die. Follow him and support every playing moving forward. Please please just don't stop going forward. The AB's in the second half just blew you away with old style rugby but the forwards are more than capable and can get the ball at the breakdown. Don't back off. You won but only just. Again just focus, composure and go forward. Never stop attacking and you will win the RWC. Good luck (Labouring Under Correct Knowledge) LUCK to you all. Go hard or go home! Defeat is not an option.

Wow so next weeks grand finale is going in as Wallabrance but leaving as Wallabies. What an easy win. We believe you'll show the Blacks whose boss tonight :)
Hey james OConnor AND THE WALLABIES IM FROM RURAL NEW SOUTH WALES AND WHEN IM OLDER I WANT TO BE A PHYSIO FOR UR TEAM AND MARRY JAMES OCONNOR !!! GOOD LUCK FOR SUNDAY ! :) <3
Hahaha in see then all balck support has gone quiet? Shame ! you guys are going to lose anyway ,us aussie's are going to carve up carrrrve up ;) with James O'Conner, David Pocock and the man Quade Cooper looking to spark up ,and hopefully he serves Richie McCaw something for all his cheating..bloody cheating allbalks
I'm Samoan and i always support the Wallabies but their performance earlier against the Boks was not so good. I really want them to win the world cup tournament. I suggest Cooper needs to WAKE UP and PLAY the game. Robbie Deans please make sure the boys are READY, i like your coaching but the All Blacks are VERY VERY strong even though they go so many injured players. Also suggest that the front row should all play like David Pocok. He was my man of the match against the Boks :) Overall "I LOVE THE WALLABIES" all the best for your match against the AB's this week.<3 Mel VavaeSamoan Wallabies Fan

I live in nz. but lived in aussie for a while. being cheering for the wallabies since childhood.GO WALLABIES! make us proud. :)
Australia will be right with you on Sunday.  Quade, every time you hear an unsportsman like Boo hear double the number of Australians cheering you on.  Sorry you have to put up with that b/s.  But we all know what you can do.  At some point the team is going to all click - then we will show them.  But look what you guys have done without really clicking.  Amazing.  Go The Wallabies.....John and Cheryl Hill

And who plans on watching the Wallabies take on the All Blacks this coming weekend?Qantas Wallabies Perth, Western Australia Perth Now Rugby World Cup We <3 Leederville Small Business Centre North West Metro 
Good win wallabies for not having the that much and l saw the eye gouge on horwill and Samo great tackle in habana and poecock and macabe had an amazing game 
Amazing, amazing game! As someone on my friendslist said, gusty win, proud as punch. Go the Wallabies in the semi-finals!!!
this is what i have to say to all the Qantas Wallabies haters out there:Love them or hate them.. BOTH are in their favor! For if you LOVE them, they are always in your heart & if you HATE them, they are always in your head. =) OneTeam2011
Just read a good one from a South African friends facebook,What does South Africa and USA have in common...?9-11 ;-)
So, Stephen Donald called up to the All Blacks.. lol. Muliaina ruled out, Carters gone, so is Slade and McCaw's.. meh. I think we couldn't have picked a better time to face the AB's.
another amazing wanabee miracle no possesion ,another lesson learnt (when are we going to learn from these lessons ),do tell quade that this is not touch rugby you have to tackle  the opposition maybe he should take some swisse ultra tablets like oconner and it might make him think and tackle .
Pocock - a god amongst men! cant wait to see the end result next weekend against the kiwis, good luck boys! cheering you on from this side of the world :-D 
James. What a great field goal. And Kefu fantastic. Now to the semi's. Let's get busy WINNING. U r all amazing. No nail-biter next match please. I have no nails left!
Well Done Wallabies, you played an amazing game and deserved to win. Pocock you are awesome! Good Luck for next weekend, do us proud! 
CONGRATS Wallabies....You should be proud!!!!! If we win our Quarter I'll go back to being nasty next week ok lol!!! Shame you lost in the pools cause it should have been an AB vs Wallabies final :-(
Good luck this weekend. Help keep sportsmanship alive with the Rugby Code (a shout out would be amazing!). Cheers http://www.facebook.com/rugbycode

Our thanks to former vice-captain of the Qantas Wallabies, David Giffin and his wife Kris for generously sharing their personal cancer journey on TheCircleTV yesterday. See how their life was turned upside down when their eldest son Joseph was diagnosed at 2 years of age. Such an amazing family.

Castrol EDGE-backed Qantas Wallabies up against USA Rugby tonight in Rugby World Cup from 6:30pm AEST on Fox Sports Australia - don't think our boys will be taking it too friendly though, do you?
HAVE FAITH TRUE WALLABIES FANS ! I BELIEVE THAT THE WALLABIES CAN AND WILL ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE !! BEAT USA, RUSSIA, STH AFRICA, NZ ALL BLACKS and MEET IRELAND AGAIN IN THE GRAND FINAL TO WIN THE RWC 2011 !! GO THE WALLABIES !!!!! BECAUSE THEY SAY IT CAN'T BE DONE !!!!  :-)
Being a proud kiwi and all blacks supporter, I am disgusted at some of the behaviour my fellow kiwis have inflicted on the Wallabies supporters, i think this has gone way to far, while there is nothing wrong with some friendly competiton i think that yelling inappropriate abuse, spitting have crossed the line and im so embarrassed by my fellow kiwi's behaviour. NZ is the host country we are meant to welcome everyone to our amazing country i dont think anyone deserves to be treated this way being from Australia or not.... All blacks supporters keep your negative comments off this page. Remember its still anyones game while im hoping it wont be an Aus - NZ final, anything can still happen!!! but go the all blacks and i wish the Wallabies the best for the rest of their RWC campaign.
not all kiwi supporters are rude and abusive! if we choke I hope you guys will be the ones to win the cup :) I was looking forward to an NZ Australia final but ah well, best of luck to you! 
Hi Rugby fans. Here is a great rugby memory for you all. One of the greatest tries in the history of this fantastic sport. Gareth Edwards for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973. To relive this amazing try scoring moment watch it on www.highdefintionsports.co.uk.
Attn: Sydney viewers the Wallabies game this friday will be on free to air at the delayed time of 9:45pm Channel9 (kick off 6:30 AEST). Not happy....
Nice to know the quality of Wallaby supporters... They don't go joining SA or NZ supporters page to post nonsense. I guess it boils down to being educated :-) 
From the Hay Cutters, to the Young Yabbies, Cootamundra Tri-colours, Albury Steamers, Aggies, Reddies, Forces, Boiled Lollies & Tahs all of Wagga, Leeton Phantoms and Griffith Blacks - fans of rugby in the Riverina, salute the Wallabies, go for Bill, don't lose sight of the prize. Back each others and become the giant killers of RWC11. 
AMAZING!!!
Awesome stuff Will Davison, Luke Youlden and Ford Performance Racing (FPR) - first 2011 win & POLE for tomorrow's L&H 500 Official V8 Supercars race! Now bring on the Qantas Wallabies in Rugby World Cup tonight - 6:30PM on Fox Sports (later on 9)

More and more sports are going social - which we <3 - the Qantas Wallabies are set to be the most socially supported team in the world cup.  Questions can be asked in live time during the tennis at the US Open Tennis Championships - what are you doing in your buisness to embrace social and fill the needs of your "fans"?
Who's psyched & organised to watch the titanic Rugby World Cup battle between the Qantas Wallabies & USA Rugby ???* 23/09/2011 - 04:30 (US EST) - AUS v USA @ Wellington... not to mention the Final...* 23/10/2011 - 03:00 (US EST) - AUS v the Springboks   ;)Aussie... Aussie... Aussie...

proud of you boys last night. You are not bedazzled by pathetic Hakka. Fell sorry for the Maori people tho. Its embarssing-whites and islanders doing the Hakkkkka? :)lol think again. They should put the Netballers instead.
Finally! wallabies won 2X in a row with tropies. AB reached their peak while Wallabies are getting better. without Richie M and Dan C - All black is nothing, they were saying "loosing the game is nothing to 'em but deep inside they are devastated especially loosing the Tri nation to Australaia. Hakkkkkka? Netballers are better off doing it LOL. How insulting it is to the Maori...they looked like trying to sell shirts and jerseys esp. the Islander (not even a Kiwi origin).
Go the Qantas Wallabies! Knew you could do it! There's another cup to bring home now <3
Rocky needs a good pat on the back! Talk about a good bloke. He has proved he plays rugby because he's passionate about the game. I think him stepping down from captaincy in such honorable way was amazing. And boy did he play well last night! Good on you, Rocky! Good luck to all the boys at the RWC. 
What a FANTASTIC Game we experienced last night - you had to be there, my voice still is, and I need to go back to find it!!! GREAT Try to Genia and Samo WHAT A STAR, That had to be Try of the year, and the rest of Guys..well I take back what I said after that Awful Samoa & Auckland.. you guys have shown Awsome heart, passion and fortitude...Keep it up the world is yours!!! O! just keep O'connor off the piss though haha! :-)

Can't stop giggling myself when the All blacks performed their haka last night and the spectators start sing their hearts out loud so nobody heard any haka's word. We should repeat the dose.lol.

the wallabies were meant to be a good team with good players. pfftt bahahaha your just a bunch of WANNABES who know they cant play as good as the best. QANTAS WANNABES should be the name of the page. Julia Gillard was your bad omen after her promotion in the advertisements in the lead up to the game. WELL DONE SAMOA!!!! ;)
GO BOYS AGAINST THOSE SPRINGIES!!! lol. Bet ev1 looking foward to the all blacks, but next weekend be a test of the team for sure. Got the ice chilling and rum ready........
Why is this page advertising the All Blacks v Wallabies game as being on 6th August at 5:30pm (AEST) when I know that in Adelaide and probably Melbourne and Perth it WON'T be shown until AFTER 11PM!
Picked up my tickets for the game today GA $20 and the fan day at 11:30am in Cathy Freeman ParkQuite shocked to see only 28,000 seats sold.Understandable its Samoa, could be a pretty easy game however I had a think about the points that clearly need to be raised.- Family Friendly with the game kicking off at 2pm on a Sunday- Cheap prices for tickets and most of the stadium GA it looks like- Fan Day on before the game with opportunities to meet the rest of the squad and the 1991 RWC Team

Tri Nations and World Cup will be win by Wallabies. You were so impressive versus France in November. Baptiste Catoen French Fan :D                                                                  
Hello. Just wondering where or how I can buy tickets to the match against New Zealand on 6th of august in Eden Park NZ? I am over there for a contiki tour and have a free night, so my friend and I want to go support the Qantas Wallabies. Thanks Ashleigh =)
Well the ARU has done it again because of THEIR weak approach in promoting the game, Rugby supporters in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth are stuck with a broadcast of the Wallabies game on Sunday at 11:30pm. Those of us on low incomes struggle to make ends meet and we cannot afford bloody Foxtel. God knows when we'll get to see the Tri-Nations matches. The channel has changed but Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth still get screwed by TV Execs!
Samoa is in the house..... receptionist said to them are you a soccer team.... lol They r training a preparing to take on the wallabies...should be interesting...to see..

If Adam likes NZ so much, how bout he fks off back over there lol. No doubt he lives in beautiful Australia. He can be apart of Australia's-swap a kiwi for a monkey program-a more productive Australia :)
Deans is no doubt the best coach in the world and he is building this team extremly well for the world cup but the players are constantly screwing things up. Gits is awesome but he needs to stop being so dam aragent and pull his finger out ...of his arse and start playing rugby which makes him the best in the world. Quade your amazing on attack but you need to learn how to tackle, teams are just running rings around him. And please someone learn how to kick we have lost countless games in the last two years because we have missed 3+ kicks every game which equals a min of 9points per game how many games have lost by margins closer than this? i would say most. The incompetence of the players to build on there skill set once the players mastered there defenense they lost there attack once they mastered the scrums they lost the lineout and now that they have mastered their attack they have lost there defense. Sort your shit out Wallabies!
I agree with Sean below - START A NATIONAL COMP! - the step from club rugby to super rugby to Wallaby level is to much.Wallabies are the most over-rated team in the world atm - cocky and over-confident after a win over an All Black side that was at about 60-70% - Get Cooper out of no.10 his random play does not control the game it just puts it under preasure....Forwards are terrible...to much to explain lol
with no oconner this week and genia & giteau on the bench,and quade subbd at 50min mark 4 giteua or barnes, whoz gonna kick??beale or barnes, theyr both crap.. expect alot of dropgoals and penalty kicks from italy,its all up 2ashley,beale ,turner, im rootn 4da eyetaiz haha . . wannabiez tha ''gay n old'' go tha allblackz man . . .

WHY are the Wallabies taking 36 players on tour away and the Allblacks only taking 30? i guess Dingo Deans needs to explore more lol...
Well done Wallabies!  You have shown that you can play 80 mins of rugby, make mistakes, dominate a game and that you have good skill and capability building up. Good work and keep building for that world cup!  PS: let's get that kicking right and you will win games comfortably! :-)
WHohoooooo!!!!.....GOOo WaLlabiies....No mattEr waTt hepanz In thiS rugbY world!!.U stilL th Bestttttttt!!...hooRayyyyyyyyyyy!!!..LOL
Now I've got a clear head, here's a quick thought on the game. This game was close, not just on the scoreboard but pretty even playing wise as well, the reason the Wallabies lost is they failed to capitalize on their kicking.Now I'm not going to blame Giteau for that, yes he was having a bad night, but he hasn't been kicking that spectacular lately anyway. After he pulled that second kick to the right a decision should have been made to pull him and put someone else up to do the kicking. It was pretty clear this was going to be a close game and waiting for Giteau to get his kicks right cost potential points.Moving forward the Wallabies are going to have to look past Giteau and Cooper for their kickers, and should now starting putting O'Connor up as the primary kicker and Beale as his backup when required. They both have a lot more years in them and both are playing and kicking well.Anyways, good game, congrats to the ABs, next time you're going down :-)
The NZ dollar is getting quite weak against the AUS dollar. Hopefully their currency gets worser when the World Cup comes round. No one will ever complain about the ticket prices ever again. lol ;-)
Im a Allblack Supporter just watched the video of McCaw over and over again Ok lets be honest yes McCaw broke early I noticed that after watching it a few times. However the ref let it go so Richie didn't "cheat" the ref simply made an error just like players do. However we should have got a penalty try for a professional foul by O'connor "Beiber" on Mils. He came from behind the ruck and stopped Mils scooping the ball back to support deliberately. It's either a penalty try or 10mins in the bin. Anyways it all doesn't matter scoreboard and history will show us winning and the aussies using any excuse they can lol. Funny now how Deans is objecting to the way McCaw plays he rather loved McCaw when he was coaching Cantab. I used to like Robbie to but he has turned into a soft whinging aussie. Sorry Mr Deans but don't come back home your not welcome.
Just remember ONE thing boys...rugby is an 80 minute game not 40!!!! DO NOT FALL APART after 40 minutes.....GO THE WALLABIES <3
Well done Wallabies! A deserved win! Steenkamp's try went to the TMO who awarded it, when the REF couldn't see the grounding of the ball, neither could WE, neither could the TMO. Was that then a "fair" call? I just know that if the "try-scorer" was an Australian, I wouldn't have been happy with that call. ;-)
A group of mates had gathered at a friend's to watch an Australia v New Zealand Test. Laying in front of the TV was the home owners dog. As the game progressed every time the All Blacks scored the dog would stand up do a back flip and lay down again much to the amazement of the guests. At the end of the game which was won by the All Blacks the dog ran around the lounge doing forward flips before resuming his place in front of the TV. " That was amazing," said one guest " but what happens when Australia win?" " I don't know," said the Kiwi owner " I've only had him 6 years."
wallabies were so awsome with ball in hand loved it when they ran it out of the try area instead of kicking it str8 bak to them, wallabies were a lil  unlucky not to have won that game had so many chances ( AAC & slipper i think both got close to the lie in the second half) defence and set play let  us down in the second half spinngboks were making the most of their chances and played well! credit to them. not sure why deans didnt go to the bench for the backs clearly there was some tired lads out there but thats his decision! we have a few areas to work on for next week but i think the guys will takee alot from the game ad i enjoyed the try fest game it was cant wait for next weekend ad sydney :D
We need to work on out support and restrain from giving away stupid penalties! But besides that.... Fucking good game boys!!!!!!Especially Mr Beale and O'Connor! Xxxx :)
Felt compelled to like this page after having a bit of a read and seeing the nonsense going on, my apologies for a couple of my fellow kiwis spamming your page with crap! We have spammers on the ABs page at the moment too, good grief what a pain lol. Great game by the Wallabies on saturday, what a joy to see good running rugby again! All the best in SA!
This is an awesome game of old!!! Love it....Infringements are on both sides...but the pure guts and determination from both teams is fantastic. Heart still beating fast as it is anyones game. This is why you never doubt the Wallabies and their ability!!! :-)
Morning guys, it's 09h30 local time in Cape Town. AND it's Test Match Saturdayyyyyyyyyy! In about 7hrs the All Black "winning streak" will STOP. Trust me. :)
Rules of the game...(a)When a player tackles an opponent and they both go to ground, the tackler must immediately release the tackled player.(b)The tackler must immediately get up or move away from the tackled player and from the ball at once.(c) The tackler must get up before playing the ball and then may play the ball from any direction.
Last time you played twice in South Africa (2008) you picked up your first win in RSA for almost a decade and then, just a week later, you suffered your worst ever test defeat to the Boks. This year, you smash the Boks and get hammered by NZ on home soil, You lost to Scotland, then hammered Wales (Who should have been much more threatening)... Its about time, you need to start playing consistent rugby!! The World Cup does NOT give you a second shot (Im Kiwi, I know!!), all the best for your trip to Africa, get back to your winning ways... Go Wallabies!!
It's 07h50 here in South Africa on test match Saturday. A few more hours and the Springboks MIGHT actually get a victory. I remain hopeful. We'll see soon enough huh? :)
So the words drop goal seem to have been removed from the Wallabies vocabulary.  We dominated possession and field position but couldn't break the AB's amazing defence.  Why not sling the ball back to someone with product in their hair and have a pop at 3 points?  Given the stats we probably had about 30 chances to do this in the match.Trying to play ball-in-hand, expansive rugby only works when you go beyond the breakdown and we didn't.  So we should have reverted to plan B, nudge it over.  Did Robbie and the boys not see the 2003 world cup final?  If we are to be a real threat to the AB's and have a shot next year we must score points when we're in their half, so if we can't score a try then take the 3 on offer.
Well done Wallabies!!! You did awesome......I love to win against the Wallabies but NOT like this. Can't wait to see you in NZ next week. You did your country proud and so did you Joubert!!!! :-)

Not making excuses mate but bloody hell the copy cats are getting away with alot. It's beyond ridiculous!! NZ capt still the cheat by moving forward 3mtrs he wouldn't of got it he was where the original penalty occurred. Also forward passing alot the hands are not flowing backwards,NZ guys not releasing  for a quick tap, eh the list goes on and we get binned for what nothing and this stupid f*cking south african ref is a f*cking joke. More importantly why can't nz kick the ball more than 10m? :)
Super dooper excited! :) burgess barnes giteau n oconnor all made it on the team yay n burgess is scrumhalf not genia. :) yay can't wait for the boks game now. Ill be there with bells on :) :) :) x

Done :)I suggest changing the colour of your calendar so these IMPORTANT dates are highlighted (mine of course is Green)Please feel free to share this will all your mates.
Thinks everyone should leave luke burgess and matt giteau alone. They are very vital players. Obviously they're good if they have been picked to play for the Wallabies. :) x
If you're in Melbourne get along to the Qantas Wallabies training session this afternoon at Ashwood Reserve, (Victoria): 3:30 - 5:00pm. Redkite will be there with volunteers from Ernst &Young.
digby and AAC need to get more involved as they have amazing attaking ability cooper has proven he is our #10 burges had a awsome start to the wallabies but there is always that combo from the super 14 ( genia and cooper) that you cant not look at, giteau needs to work on his all round kicking game and his attacking line running if he is to keep the 12 jersey oconnor allways seems to have huge heart when he plays always running at the line 110% he backs himself well, which all the wallabies need to start doing. there is so much deans can do with the back line its awsome but he need to pick what works.... and what backs combonation click!!!!
9-genia10-cooper11-mitchell12-oconnor/giteau13-AAC14-Ioane15-Giteau/oconnorhahaha now that would be interesting lol huge attacking potential there

Thanks to the lads that made my 15yr old daughters day yesti (Sunday) in the Qantas Club @ Brisbane Airport... As you saw, Molly was a little excited (totally beside herself actually) when she noticed the boys sitting all round the Q-Club and when a couple of them got up and went over to her for a chat and photo-opp' it turned what was a 'not-so-nice' trip to Newcastle (for her Grandma's funeral) into an amazingly memorable experience for her!!! So a HUGE thank you boys (Saia & Ben I think she said)... She was stoked with the autographs from Ballymore last Monday & post-game Satdi night but that topped her week off ~ Cheers!  C'arn The Wallabies  :o)
Congrats Wallabies...We were cheering for you way over here in the Middle East. You did Australia proud!!! Sorry, but being a Kiwi, next weekend I really have to support the AB's. See you all in Melbourne!!!! :-)
for all aussie fans living in edinburgh, biddy mulligans have aust vs england playing live at 11am and NZ vs Ireland at 8am :) come down and cheer for the wallabies!

A new name for the team could be the Aussie Lotto team The players have a 1 in 3,838,000 chance of being picked from the squad of 30 odd players. and there is a long time between games to get continuity because the same team will not be together for another 8,659,000 games. Be that as it may, the fastest player in the game will be sitting in the crowd. What a waste. I certainly would have LT on the wing. Good luck Wallabies, try this old one; go you good thing, and let the hairs grow back. Show the world you are men not to be reckoned with.
Rocky Elsom, George Smith, Matt Giteau, Stephen Moore, Drew Mitchell and Wil Genia are confirmed starters for the Baa Baas clash against All Blacks in December :D
does anyone know which channel the spring tour and the mid week match will be broadcasted from?? This is for queensland by the way =) 
Man I can't believe we lost to the kiwis!! But in the end I think they were the better team as soon as they ran on to their home ground. But we will beat em next year! STUPID ALL BLACKS!!! Go the WALLABIES!!!!!!!!! At least we don't stuff up in the world cup like they do... Hahahahahahha! :)
wow sitting 20 meters from the try line to see a close 2nd try was amazing... fantastic atmosphere at the Twickers... great game.. grand slam heading down under :)
Viva bokke!!! We've done it laads... Anyway i wana 2 aussies win next week even tho u blokes gave us our only defeat lol. Let the ABs finish last on the log!!
the 40+ guys named for the training of the touring squad look good, the 10 new younge fellas will get to make a mark and hopefully show they want to play rugby. once again they are all still kids which is awsome lol 2 years time when the world cup comes banging on every1's doorsteps we will have a very experienced and also prob the youngest team at the world cup looking good boys! CARN THE WALLABIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats on the win against Gloucester! Good luck wth the game against England :) A true Wallabies fan is one who stands by them through thick and thin and you are simply the best! Go The Wallabies!
yes our men of gold lost but please show support for our wallabies. They are up against some strong teams & yes we will lose a couple of games. But why is it though when a team loses, we start playing the blame game and asking for heads on the chopping block?? I know that I could never be able to achieve what these guys have accomplished so far or play a full 80 minute game of getting the crap beaten out of me. To the Wallabies, learn from this game and move forward so we can beat the kiwis in Tokyo :)
hmm.. that win for the Boks is good. The Bledisloe may now be gone but the Wallabies are only 2 points behind the ABs on the Tri-Nations ladder. If they can keep up the good form of last weekend and win next weekend at least they wouldn't be taking out the wooden spoon. Would be a great way to finish the series given the poor form at the start of it. Let's go Aussies :-)
finaly we are looking good in the backline! with quade at second and digby in at centre and adam at full back its a solid and very exciting looking back line cant wait for the game :D
thank u for today :) its a shame i didn't meet the rest of the guys but i still got to see bam pocock :) certainly makes my day. Will post my few photos on soon :)
2 my favourite guys. I hope that brisvegas brings u some extra good luck this week :) i'll be there cheering u on!! And if its possible could bam pocock be at the player day? I would understand if he wasn't as his family is here :) or maybe a force player?
Hi guys!!! I cant wait until the 3rd of Sept!! woo hoo!! I would like to nominate Berrick Barnes (for Lauren), David Pocock, Nahan Sharpe/Drew Mitchell and Geroge Smith/ Matt Giteau. Maybe someone from the Force would be good :) or even now ex force ;) But I would understand that Bam Bam might want to spend the day with his parents on the Goldy..
is woundering if the boks are peaking too soon! like the all blacks before the last world cup and they went in as fav but couldnt go the distance. i feel after this year the wallabies will have developed and gained from these experiences. and by the time the world cup comes around in 2011 the wallabies will be a mojor threat, our scrums are no longer pushovers and we have amazing talent in the backline that can on their day can destroy an oponent, what the wallabies havent had much of this trinations is luck! weather it be the bounce of the ball or the ref decission, its hard to win games when things you cant control dont go your way!
Congratulations Wallabies on sticking at it and proving you have it in you to win! The enthusiasm and persisitence was amazing from you guys!!!! Well Done...GO WALLABIES!!
well it is hard to say because the springboks is the best team in the world and it is proven so it is hard to say.i would say none lol no they have been beaten on aussie soil
What is happening guys?!?! Is it the players? coaching staff? nerves? :( good start to the second half though! got  a bit anxious when habana scored again and switched channels lol..Good game o'connor.. but in saying that.. what is happening??

That Ref needs to learn the rules of scrums.........it was that close of a game, that the refs bad calls lost us the match. Yea i know it a cliche' but that ref needs to "uppercut himself in the head" as quoted from one of the aussie commentators lol
I so wanted to fly down to Cape Town this weekend, but unfortunately everything is soooo expensive!:( but, i'll still be watching the game, 'up north', wearing my Wallabies jersey and cap! hehe... And get 'slaughtered' in the process...;)
please come join and have a bit of fun           http://www.facebook.com/pages/Springboks/19082314575?sid=36bced3d6c6d3ede32e0bc942d77c2e8&ref=s#/group.php?gid=54629842383&ref=mf
lol... The All Blacks have a habit of destroying opposition players 100th tests when it looks least likely. ie. George Smiths [22-16, Auckland 18JUL09] after losing to second string French side and stuttering past Italy and Percy Montgomerys last year [All Blacks 19-0 Springboks, 16AUG08] after losing home test match to Springboks in Dunedin (first home loss in 5 years) and 19-34 loss to Wallabies in Sydney!!!
hey hey guys :) only a month to go until i see you :) although my only friend, my dad, will be away that weekend, I will still be there to cheer you on!!!! Loner is my new name and the wallabies playin rugby is my game :)
Woohoo :) Awesome match!!! So proud that I couldn't wipe the smile off my face.The boys gave it their all and conquered. Gotta say the younger guys sure played exceptionally well- congrats to James O'Connor!!!Keep it up guys, will be behind u all the way :)
C'mon Aussies, this is "The Decider" on who gets to take the trophies for 2008, Tri-Nations and Bledisloe (I think?). The Japan match doesn't count, does it? I know we can win it! :)
Great game last night!  Great atmosphere at Subiaco Oval with 41,838 fans screaming and cheeing the Wallabies to a brilliant win.  Fingers crossed Stirling is back on deck after taking down 4 Boks (well done Stirling you're a legend).  Bring on next week against the All Blacks - crush 'em boyz!!

So pleased Sydney airport has the most inefficient customs/transit service on the planet - I now have three additional hours to be nauseated by the sexual and relationship adventures of the eternally innocent Anastasia Steele and the ever so fucked up Christian Grey. I really think Stephanie Meyers should sue for breach of copyright, these books follow the exact formula set up in the Twilight books, the only things these two don't do is suck each other's blood (although that could still be coming). Why I've made it to book three I don't know but thanks to Qantas I'll be able to finish, so happy right now *8)*

I feel so incredibly blessed to be able to experience the purity and natural beauty of australia's beaches and it's rejuvenating power. Don't be a shit human and litter this planet. It doesn't belong to us, we belong to it and its f*cking amazing.

Like gump once said, me & jenny we go together like peas and carrots...and so  too does #therook burger with chips... A sneaky little roof top bar/ restaurant on york st... Perfect presentation, #burgernchips  nestled nicely on a plate rather then the dreaded breadboard... Nice to have some chips this week after the much publicised #rockpoolbarandgrill chip FAIL last #burgerfriday... The rook burger delivered in many ways... Super stackability, juicy slab of wagyu, perky pickle, cheddar cheese and tastey relish... However, agreeing w/ my burger buddy, the burger was a bit 'bunny' and it rang true... Like the caramelised shell of a creme brulee, the bun is the entrance point of the burger,  it's that pivotal first impression. But all too often it becomes the 12th man... It's there as a filler only... But all said, great service and at $20 with chips ... Hard to beat for a cbd burger... It gets a 'ran strong' 7 patty rating out of 10...#sydney #australia #burgers #burgerreview #burgerrating #relish
